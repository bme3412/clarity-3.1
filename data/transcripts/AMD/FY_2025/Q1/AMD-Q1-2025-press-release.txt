Current Outlook
AMD’s outlook statements are based on current expectations. The following statements are
forward-looking and actual results could differ materially depending on market conditions and
the factors set forth under “Cautionary Statement” below.
For the second quarter of 2025, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $7.4 billion, plus
or minus $300 million. Non-GAAP gross margin is estimated to be 43% inclusive of
approximately $800 million in charges for inventory and related reserves due to the new export
controls as previously disclosed in AMD’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 16, 2025.
Excluding this charge, non-GAAP gross margin would be approximately 54%.

(*) In this earnings press release, in addition to GAAP financial results, AMD has provided non-GAAP financial measures including nonGAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses/revenue%, non-GAAP
operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. AMD uses a
normalized tax rate in its computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision to provide better consistency across the reporting periods.
For fiscal 2025, AMD used a non-GAAP tax rate of 13%, which excludes the tax impact of pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments. AMD also
provided adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and free cash flow margin as supplemental non-GAAP measures of its performance. These
items are defined in the footnotes to the selected corporate data tables provided at the end of this earnings press release. AMD is
providing these financial measures because it believes this non-GAAP presentation makes it easier for investors to compare its
operating results for current and historical periods and also because AMD believes it assists investors in comparing AMD’s
performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that it does not believe are indicative of its core
operating performance and for the other reasons described in the footnotes to the selected data tables. The non-GAAP financial
measures disclosed in this earnings press release should be viewed in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to AMD’s
reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with AMD’s Consolidated Financial
Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures referenced are reconciled to their most directly
comparable GAAP financial measures in the data tables in this earnings press release. This earnings press release also contains
forward-looking non-GAAP gross margin concerning AMD’s financial outlook, which is based on current expectations as of May 6,
2025, and assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Adjustments to arrive at the GAAP gross margin
outlook typically include stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related and other costs.
The timing and impact of such adjustments are dependent on future events that are typically uncertain or outside of AMD's control,
therefore, a reconciliation to equivalent GAAP measures is not practicable at this time. AMD undertakes no intent or obligation to
publicly update or revise its outlook statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required
by law.

adjusting GAAP net income for interest expense, other (income) expense, net, income tax provision (benefit), equity income in investee, stockbased compensation, depreciation and amortization expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, inventory loss at contract
manufacturer, acquisition-related and other costs, and restructuring charges. The Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because
management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds.
In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across
reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The
Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same
industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of net income or GAAP liquidity measures of
cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and
liabilities that can affect cash flows.

The Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by adjusting
GAAP net cash provided by operating activities for capital expenditures, and free cash flow margin % is free cash flow expressed as a percentage




of the Company's net revenue. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because
management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow
may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view free cash
flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities.
