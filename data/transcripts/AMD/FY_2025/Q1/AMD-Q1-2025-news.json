The Data Center segment grew ~57 % to ~$3.7 billion, driven by EPYC CPUs and Instinct GPUs, while Client & Gaming revenue rose ~28 % to ~$2.9 billion, powered by a ~68 % jump in Client lead processors; Gaming declined ~30 % due to semi-custom weakness. Embedded revenue slipped ~3 % to ~$823 million. Gross margin improved to ~54 % non-GAAP. Management emphasised expanding AI and data-center momentum, but noted regulatory risks – especially export restrictions to China – and indicated Q2 guidance reflecting those headwinds. These results set the stage for AMD’s 2025 growth narrative in compute and AI, though near-term margin and China exposure remain key risk levers.",

Data Center revenue grew ~57%, underpinned by EPYC CPUs and Instinct GPUs, while Client revenue soared ~68% driven by high-end Ryzen processors and richer ASPs. Gaming remains under pressure, with a ~30% decline tied to console chip cutbacks and semi-custom softness. Embedded continues to be a drag. Importantly, while the underlying operating performance is improving, export controls—specifically restrictions on shipments to China of MI308/AI accelerators—represent an estimated ~$1.5 billion headwind in 2025. From a margin standpoint, AMD achieved ~54% gross margin (non-GAAP) and is leveraging cost scale. For a RAG index, this narrative helps tie together AMD’s product roadmap, AI/compute strategy, growth vectors, and regulatory/geopolitical cross-winds in Q1 2025.",

CFO Jean Hu noted investment in R&D and go-to-market to support long-term growth. Analysts pressed on timing of MI350/MI355 AI accelerator rollout and regulatory/licensing drag in China.

Guidance for Q2 (~$7.4 billion revenue) embeds that caution.
