The Data Center business delivered ~$4.3 billion (+22% YoY) driven by EPYC CPUs and Instinct MI350 series GPUs. The Client & Gaming segment delivered ~ $4.0 billion (+73% YoY) with Client revenue ~$2.8 billion and Gaming ~$1.3 billion (+181% YoY). The Embedded segment slipped ~8% to ~$857 million. Management emphasised broad-based compute momentum, especially in AI/data center and premium client. Importantly, the quarter did not include any revenue from the MI308 GPU shipments to China — a notable headwind until regulatory/licensing issues are resolved. AMD provided Q4 guidance of roughly $9.3-9.9 billion revenue (midpoint ~25% growth) and gross margin target ~54.5%, reinforcing confidence in scaling compute franchise. This quarter therefore serves as a clear inflection point for AMD’s high-performance computing and AI strategy moving into fiscal 2026.",

While Data Center grew ~22% to ~$4.3 billion and Client/Gaming ~73% to ~$4.0 billion, the embedded business remains weak (~-8%). The piece stresses that AMD’s software stack (ROCm) and ecosystem momentum are becoming strategic differentiators. On the risk side, the continued exclusion of MI308 shipments to China highlights regulatory and export-control overhangs that could either lift margins or constrain upside.
