"We delivered an outstanding quarter, with record revenue and profitability reflecting
broad based demand for our high-performance EPYC and Ryzen processors and Instinct AI
accelerators," said Dr. Lisa Su, AMD chair and CEO. "Our record third quarter performance and
strong fourth quarter guidance marks a clear step up in our growth trajectory as our expanding
compute franchise and rapidly scaling data center AI business drive significant revenue and
earnings growth."
“We delivered record quarterly revenue of $9.2 billion, up 36% year-over-year, and
generated record free cash flow, reflecting the strength of our leadership portfolio and
disciplined execution,” said Jean Hu, AMD executive vice president, chief financial officer and

Segment Summary
• Data Center segment revenue was $4.3 billion, up 22% year-over-year primarily driven
by strong demand for 5th Gen AMD EPYC™ processors and AMD Instinct MI350 Series
GPUs.
• Client and Gaming segment revenue was $4 billion, up 73% year-over-year. Client
revenue was a record $2.8 billion, up 46% year-over-year primarily driven by record
sales of Ryzen™ processors and a richer product mix. Gaming revenue was $1.3 billion,
up 181% year-over-year driven by higher semi-custom revenue and strong demand for
Radeon™ gaming GPUs.

AMD’s outlook statements are based on current expectations. The following statements are
forward-looking and actual results could differ materially depending on market conditions and
the factors set forth under “Cautionary Statement” below.
For the fourth quarter of 2025, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $9.6 billion, plus

growth of approximately 25% and sequential growth of approximately 4%. Non-GAAP gross
margin is expected to be approximately 54.5%. Our current outlook does not include any
revenue from AMD Instinct MI308 shipments to China.

(*) In this earnings press release, in addition to GAAP financial results, AMD has provided non-GAAP financial measures including nonGAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses/revenue percent, nonGAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. AMD uses a
normalized tax rate in its computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision to provide better consistency across the reporting periods.
For fiscal 2025, AMD used a non-GAAP tax rate of 13%, which excludes the tax impact of pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments. Additionally,
AMD has provided an adjusted non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin for the second quarter of 2025 which excluded the inventory
and related charges associated with U.S. export restrictions. AMD also provides adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and free cash flow
margin as supplemental non-GAAP measures of its performance. These items are defined in the footnotes to the selected corporate
data tables provided at the end of this earnings press release. AMD is providing these financial measures because it believes this nonGAAP presentation makes it easier for investors to compare its operating results for current and historical periods and also because
AMD believes it assists investors in comparing AMD’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items
that it does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance and for the other reasons described in the footnotes to the
selected data tables. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this earnings press release should be viewed in addition to and
not as a substitute for or superior to AMD’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction
with AMD’s Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures referenced
are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the data tables in this earnings press release. This
earnings press release also contains forward-looking non-GAAP gross margin concerning AMD’s financial outlook, which is based on
current expectations as of November 4, 2025, and assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Adjustments
to arrive at the GAAP gross margin outlook typically include stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets and
acquisition-related and other costs. The timing and impact of such adjustments are dependent on future events that are typically
uncertain or outside of AMD's control, therefore, a reconciliation to equivalent GAAP measures is not practicable at this time. AMD
undertakes no intent or obligation to publicly update or revise its outlook statements as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise, except as may be required by law.

Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,431 $ 1,088 $ 1,887 $ 5,473 $ 4,612
The Company presents “Adjusted EBITDA” as a supplemental measure of its performance. Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by
adjusting GAAP net income for interest expense, other (income) expense, net, income tax provision (benefit), equity income in investee, stockbased compensation, depreciation and amortization expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition-related and other costs,
inventory loss at (recovery from) contract manufacturer, loss contingency on legal matter, and income from discontinued operations, net of tax. The
Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its
overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this
measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does
not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the
calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP
operating measure of net income or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted
EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flows.
(3) Reconciliation of GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities of Continuing Operations to Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow margin % 17% 15% 7% 14% 7%
The Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by adjusting
GAAP net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for capital expenditures, and free cash flow margin % is free cash flow
expressed as a percentage of the Company's net revenue. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings
press release because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s
calculation of free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors
should not view free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities.
