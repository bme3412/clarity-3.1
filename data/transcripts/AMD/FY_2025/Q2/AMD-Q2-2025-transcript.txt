Communicopia and Technology Conference on Monday, September 8.
Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on our current beliefs, assumptions, and
expectations, speaks only as of today, and as such involves risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ materially from our current expectations.
Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information on factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially. With that, I will hand the call over to Lisa.
LISA SU: Thank you, Matt. And good afternoon to all those listening today. We delivered very strong second quarter
results, with revenue exceeding the midpoint of guidance as higher EPYC and Ryzen processor sales more than
offset headwinds from export controls that impacted Instinct sales.
We set records for both EPYC and Ryzen CPU sales, reflecting the broad-based demand for our differentiated,
high-performance data center, PC, and embedded processors. Second quarter revenue increased 32% year over
year to a record $7.7 billion, and we delivered over $1 billion in free cash flow.
Excluding the $800 million inventory writedown, related to data center AI export controls, gross margin was 54%,
marking our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion led by a richer product mix. Turning to
the segments, data center segment revenue increased 14% year-over-year to $3.2 billion.
We saw robust demand across our EPYC portfolio to power cloud and enterprise workloads and increasingly for
emerging AI use cases. In particular, adoption of agentic AI is creating additional demand for general-purpose
compute infrastructure, as customers quickly realize that each token generated by a GPU triggers multiple CPUintensive tasks.
Against this backdrop, 5th-gen EPYC Turin shipments ramped significantly, and we had sustained demand for our
prior generation EPYC processors. As a result, we set records for both cloud and enterprise CPU sales and
delivered our 33rd consecutive quarter of year-over-year share gains.
In cloud, adoption expanded with the largest hyperscalers as they deployed EPYC to power more of their missioncritical infrastructure, services, and public cloud products. More than 100 new AMD-powered cloud instances
launched in the quarter, including multiple Turin instances from Google and Oracle Cloud that deliver up to twice
the performance of our previous generation, which were already the industry's highest-performing offerings.
There are now nearly 1,200 EPYC cloud instances available globally, as providers continue expanding both the
breadth and regional availability of their AMD offerings. This continued expansion is accelerating enterprise
adoption of EPYC in the cloud, with deployments growing significantly from the prior quarter as we closed large
wins with dozens of large aerospace, streaming, financial services, retail, and energy companies.
EPYC adoption also grew with telecom customers, as providers modernize their infrastructure for next-generation
networks. For example, KDDI announced plans to deploy EPYC processors to power its 5G virtualized network,
and Nokia selected EPYC for its cloud platform used by service providers to build, deploy, and manage core
network functions.
Turning to enterprise on-prem adoption, HPE, Dell, Lenovo and Supermicro launched 28 new Turin platforms in
the quarter that delivered leadership performance, efficiency, and TCO across a wide range of enterprise
workloads. EPYC enterprise deployments grew significantly from the prior quarter, supported by new wins with
large technology, automotive, manufacturing, financial services, and public sector customers.
To extend our momentum with SMB and hosted IT service customers, we launched the EPYC 4005 series that
combine enterprise-grade performance and features in cost-optimized platforms, purpose-built for smaller-scale
deployments.
Turning to HPC, AMD now powers more than 1/3 of the world's fastest supercomputers, including El Capitan and
Frontier, which retained the number 1 and number 2 spots on the latest top 500 list. We also powered 12 of the
top 20 systems on the Green 500, highlighting the performance per watt advantages of EPYC and Instinct for
large-scale deployments.
Looking ahead, we remain bullish on our server CPU business, driven by durable tailwinds, including growing
demand for cloud and on-prem compute, sustained share gains, and the growing investments in general-purpose
infrastructure required to enable AI.
Turning to our data center AI business, revenue declined year-over-year as US export restrictions effectively
eliminated MI308 sales to China, and we began transitioning to our next-generation MI350 series accelerators.
We made solid progress with MI300 and MI325 in the quarter, closing new wins and expanding adoption with tier1 customers, next-generation AI cloud providers, and end users.
Today, 7 of the top 10 model builders and AI companies use Instinct, underscoring the performance and TCO
advantages of our data center AI solutions. We launched our Instinct MI350 series with industry-leading memory
bandwidth and capacity and broad adoption across hyperscalers, AI companies, and OEMs.
From a competitive standpoint, MI355 matches or exceeds B200 in critical training and inference workloads and
delivers comparable performance to GB200 for key workloads at significantly lower cost and complexity. For atscale inferencing, MI355 delivers up to 40% more tokens per dollar, providing leadership performance and clear
TCO advantages.
With the MI350 series, we're also expanding our system-level capabilities to support deployments powered by
AMD CPUs, GPUs, and NICs. As one example, Oracle is building a 27,000-plus node AI cluster combining MI355
accelerators, 5th-gen EPYC Turin CPUs, and Pollara 400 SmartNICs.
We began volume production of the MI350 series ahead of schedule in June, and expect a steep production ramp
in the second half of the year to support large-scale production deployments with multiple customers.
Our Sovereign AI engagements accelerated in the quarter, as governments around the world adopt AMD
technology to build secure AI infrastructure and advance their economies. As one example, we announced a
multi-billion dollar collaboration with UMaine to build AI infrastructure powered entirely on AMD CPUs, GPUs, and
software.
Initial deployments are underway in key regions, with quarterly expansions planned over the coming years. In
addition, we have more than 40 active engagements globally and see significant opportunities to power an
increasingly larger portion of national computing centers and sovereign AI initiatives.
On the AI software front, we made significant progress this quarter increasing the performance, improving the
usability, and expanding the adoption of ROCm. We announced ROCm 7 with major upgrades across every layer
of the stack, delivering more than 3x higher inferencing and training performance, compared to our prior
generation, and adding support for large scale training, distributed inference, and lower precision data types.
The deepened developer engagement, we introduced nightly ROCm builds and expanded access to instant
compute infrastructure, including launching our first Developer Cloud that provides pre-configured containers for
instant access to AMD GPUs. We also expanded native support for ROCm across key frameworks including vLLM
and SGLang, enabling frontier models like Llama 4, Gemma 3, and DeepSeek R1 to launch with Day 0 AMD
support.
To accelerate enterprise adoption, we introduced ROCm Enterprise AI, a full-stack platform that integrates
seamlessly with existing IT infrastructure and includes everything needed for an enterprise to deploy, manage,
and scale AI across their business.
Looking ahead, the development of our next-generation MI400 series is progressing rapidly. These are the most
advanced GPUs we have ever built, with up to 40 petaflops of FP4 AI performance and 50% more memory,
memory bandwidth, and scale out throughput than the competition.
With the MI400 series, we're bringing together everything we've learned across silicon, software, and systems to
deliver Helios, a full-stack, rack-scale AI platform. Helios is purpose-built for the most demanding AI workloads,
with each rack connecting up to 72 GPUs that can operate as a single massive AI accelerator.
Helios is expected to deliver up to a 10x generational performance increase for the most advanced frontier
models. And we believe it will be the highest performance AI system in the world when it launches. MI400 series
development is progressing well towards our planned launch in 2026, with significant interest in large-scale
deployments from multiple high-profile customers.
To accelerate our development, we have invested significantly to expand our AI software and hardware
capabilities both organically and inorganically with a number of acquisitions and strategic investments. We
strengthened our software stack last quarter with the addition of the Brium and Lamini teams, building on our
acquisitions of NOD.AI, Mipsology, and Silo AI.
On the hardware side, we added a world-class rack and data center scale design team in the second quarter with
our acquisition of ZT Systems. The ZT team has integrated seamlessly, and they are actively engaging with
multiple customers to accelerate deployments of our Helios solutions at scale. We also announced last quarter
that Sanmina intends to acquire ZT US-based manufacturing business, becoming our lead partner for AI rack
manufacturing.
Turning to the AI regulatory environment, earlier this quarter, we were notified by the Department of Commerce
that it is moving forward with the review of our license applications to export MI308 to China. We appreciate the
focus the Trump administration is placing on ensuring that the US technology remains central to global AI
infrastructure. And we expect to resume MI308 shipments as licenses are approved, subject to end customer
demand and supply chain readiness.
As our licenses are still under review, we are not including any MI308 revenue in our third-quarter guidance.
Despite that, we expect revenue to grow year-over-year in the third quarter, driven by the ramp of MI350 at
multiple customers.
In client and gaming, segment revenue increased 69% year-over-year to $3.6 billion, driven by record client CPU
sales and strong demand for our semi-custom game console SoCs and Radeon GPUs. Client revenue increased
67% year-over-year to $2.5 billion, led by record desktop CPU sales.
Demand for our latest generation Ryzen 9000 series was strong, especially for our differentiated X3D processors.
We delivered record desktop channel CPU sales, as Ryzen processors consistently topped the bestselling CPU
lists at major global e-tailers throughout the quarter.
We also expanded our Zen 5 desktop portfolio with the launch of our latest Threadripper processors that feature
up to 96 cores and deliver up to double the performance of the competition in many popular content creation and
design workloads.
In mobile, demand for AMD-powered notebooks was strong, with sell-out growing by a large double-digit
percentage year over year. We drove a richer mix of higher ASP mobile parts year-over-year as we expanded our
share in the premium notebook segment, where our Ryzen AI 300 CPUs deliver leadership, performance, and
value for both general-purpose and AI workloads.
In commercial PCs, Ryzen adoption accelerated as OEM consumption increased more than 25% year-over-year.
We saw strong sell-through for AMD commercial notebooks with Lenovo and HP, and a significant uptick in Dell
sales as they ramp availability of their AMD commercial portfolio.
We also closed new enterprise wins with Forbes 2000 pharma, tech, automotive, financial services, aerospace,
and health care companies. We expect to continue growing our commercial client share, based on the strength
of our product portfolio and expanded breadth of OEM offerings.
Looking more broadly, we remain confident we can continue growing client processor revenue ahead of the
market over the coming quarters, driven by increased adoption of our desktop and notebook products, growing
commercial momentum, and a richer product mix.
In gaming, revenue increased 73% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. Semi-custom revenue increased by a large
double-digit percentage year-over-year, as console inventories inventory is normalized and our customers began
preparing for the holiday season.
We announced a new, multiyear collaboration with Microsoft for custom chips that will power the next generation
of Xbox devices, including consoles, PCs, and handhelds. We also deepened our collaboration with Sony through
Project Amethyst, a co-engineering program that will use machine learning to power the next wave of immersive
gaming experiences.
In PC gaming, demand for our latest generation Radeon 9000 series GPUs was very strong, with desktop GPUs
sell-through accelerating in the quarter, as demand outpaced supply. We launched the Radeon 9600 XT,
extending the performance advantages of RDNA 4 to mainstream gamers and delivering a significant uplift in
gaming performance, including more than double the ray tracing of our prior generation.
As part of our end-to-end AI strategy, we introduced the Radeon AI PRO R9700 GPU for local inferencing, model
fine-tuning, and other data-intensive workloads. The R9700 features more memory, full ROCm support, and
multi-GPU scalability, enabling advanced AI development and deployment directly on the desktop.
Turning to our embedded segment, revenue decreased 4% year-over-year to $824 million. Demand continues
recovering gradually with sell-through in the second quarter picking up, as strength in most markets was offset
by a few pockets of softness in inventory reduction actions, largely with industrial customers.
We expanded our embedded portfolio with the first production shipments of Spartan UltraScale+ FPGAs that
deliver leadership performance and advanced security for cost-sensitive, low-power applications.
Adoption of our Versal adaptive SoCs continues expanding in high-end applications, including next-generation
Robotaxi platforms developed by Bosch in Europe, where Versal serves as a high-performance controller enabling
real-time processing, security, and encryption in fully electric automated vehicles.
Looking ahead, we expect improving demand in the test and measurement, communications, and aerospace
markets will drive a return to sequential growth in the second half of 2025. Longer-term design win momentum
continues to build tracking ahead of this point last year and putting us on pace to surpass the record $14 billion
in design wins we achieved in 2024.
In summary, demand is very strong across our product portfolio, and we are well-positioned to deliver significant
growth in the second half of the year, led by the steep ramp of MI350 series accelerators and ongoing EPYC and
Ryzen share gains.
Our server and PC CPU businesses are accelerating, driven by growing demand for high-performance compute,
sustained share gains, the strength of our product portfolio, and expanded go-to market investments. Our
embedded-in-gaming businesses are returning to growth and are well-positioned for long-term success,
supported by strong design-win momentum.
And in AI, we are seeing strong adoption of our MI350 series and ROCm 7, as we deliver leadership performance
and TCO advantages across a broader range of workloads and ramp deployments with an expanded set of cloud
and enterprise customers.
Looking ahead, we see a clear path to scaling our AI business to 10's of billions of dollars in annual revenue. We
are very excited about our next-generation MI400 series, which is another giant step forward on our roadmap
and has been designed to deliver leadership performance at the chip, server, and rack levels. Customer interest
for the MI400 series is very strong, and we are actively engaging with an expanding set of customers to support
large-scale deployments in 2026.
We are in the early stages of an industry-wide AI transformation that will drive a step function increase in
compute demand across all of our markets, positioning us for significant revenue and earnings growth over the
coming years. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our second quarter
results. Jean.
JEAN HU: Thank you, Lisa. And good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results and then provide
our outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2025. We are pleased with our strong second-quarter financial results.
We delivered record revenue of $7.7 billion, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance, up 32% year-over-year,
reflecting strong momentum across our business.
Record sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors and higher semi-custom shipment more than offset the impact of the
US export controls, restricting MI308 sales to China. Revenue increased 3% sequentially due to strong growth in
the client and gaming segment, partially offset by the data center revenue decrease due to export controls.
Gross margin was 43%, down 10 points from 53% a year ago. The decrease was due to the $800 million
inventory and related charges associated with the export restrictions. Excluding this charge, non-GAAP gross
margin would have been approximately 54%.
Operating expenses were approximately $2.4 billion, and an increase of 32% year-over-year, as we continue to
invest aggressively in go-to market activities for revenue growth and in R&D to capitalize on significant future AI
expansion opportunities.
Operating income was $897 million, representing a 12% operating margin compared to $1.3 billion, or 22% a
year ago. The decline was primarily due to the inventory and related charges. Taxes, interest expense, and other
totaled $126 million. For the second quarter of 2025, diluted earnings per share were $0.48, compared to $0.69 a
year ago. The inventory and related charges reduced earnings per share by approximately $0.43.
Now turning to our reportable segment, starting with the data center. Data center segment revenue was $3.2
billion, up 14% year-over-year, driven by strong EPYC CPU revenue and the share gains across both cloud and
enterprise customers. On a sequential basis, data center revenue decreased 12% due to the impact of the export
controls on MI308.
The data center segment operating loss was $155 million, compared to operating income of $743 million a year
ago, or 26% of revenue. The loss was primarily due to the inventory and related charges. Client and gaming
segment revenue was $3.6 billion, up 69% year-over-year and 20% sequentially, driven by record client CPU
sales and strong demand for our PC and console gaming products.
In the client business, revenue was a record of $2.5 billion, up 67% year over year, driven by record sales of our
Ryzen desktop CPUs and richer product mix. Gaming revenue rose to $1.1 billion, up 73% year-over-year,
reflecting strong demand for our newly launched gaming GPUs and higher semi-custom revenue as inventory has
now normalized and customers prepare for the holiday season.
Client and gaming segment operating income was $767 million, or 21% of revenue, compared to $166 million, or
8% a year ago, driven by richer client product mix and operating leverage on higher revenue.
Embedded segment revenue was $824 million, down 4% year-over-year and flat sequentially, as embedded and
market demand remains mixed. Embedded segment operating income was $275 million, or 33% of revenue,
compared to $345 million, or 40% a year ago. The decline in operating income was primarily due to product mix.
Before I review the balance sheet and the cash flow, as a reminder, we closed the acquisition of ZT Systems early
in the second quarter. As we had announced our intent to divest ZT manufacturing business, the financial results
of the ZT manufacturing business are reported separately in our financial statements as discontinued operations
and are excluded from our non-GAAP financials.
Subsequently, in May, we entered into an agreement with the Sanmina Corporation to sell the ZT manufacturing
business for $3 billion in cash and stock, inclusive of contingent payments. The transaction is expected to close
near the end of 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, during the quarter, we generated $1.5 billion in cash from operating
activities of continuing operations, and free cash flow was a record of $1.2 billion. We returned $478 million to
shareholders through share repurchases, resulting in $1.2 billion in share repurchases for the first half of 2025.
In May, our board of directors approved an additional $6 billion authorization. Exiting the quarter, we have $9.5
billion remaining under our share repurchase program. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments were $5.9 billion. Our long-term debt was $3.2 billion. During the quarter, we paid down
$950 million of commercial paper used to finance the ZT system acquisition clause.
Now turning to our third quarter 2025 outlook, please note that our third quarter outlook does not include any
revenue from AMD Instinct MI308 shipment to China, as our license applications are currently under review by US
government. For the third quarter of 2025, we expect revenue to be approximately $8.7 billion, plus or minus
$300 million.
The midpoint of our guidance represents approximately 28% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by strong
double-digit growth in our client and gaming and data center segments. Sequentially, we expect revenue to grow
by approximately 13%, driven by strong double-digit growth in the data center segment with the ramp of our
AMD Instinct MI350 series GPU products.
Modest growth in our client gaming segment, with client revenue increasing and gaming revenue to be flattish.
And our embedded segment revenue to return to growth. In addition, we expect third-quarter non-GAAP gross
margin to be approximately 54%, and we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $2.55
billion.
We expect net interest and other expenses to be, again, over approximately $10 million. We expect our nonGAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.63 billion shares.
In closing, we executed very well in the first half of the year, delivering record revenue and building strong
momentum for growth in the second half. The strategic investment we are making position us to capitalize on the
expanding AI opportunities across all our end markets, driving sustainable long-term revenue growth and
earnings expansion for compelling value creation. With that, I'll turn it back to Matt for the Q&A session.
MATTHEW
RAMSAY:
Operator, will you please pull the audience for questions? Thank you.
MODERATOR: Yes, thank you, Matt. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a
question, please press star 1 on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate that your line is in the
queue. You may press star 2 to remove yourself from the queue.
For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up the handset before pressing the star
keys. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. One moment please,
while we poll for questions. And the first question comes from the line of Thomas O'Malley with Barclays. Please
proceed with your question.
THOMAS
O'MALLEY:
Hey, thank you for taking my questions. And I appreciate it. Lisa, I want to start on the client business. So you
had previously laid out a second-half outlook that was roughly flattish with the first half, as you were kind of
protecting against some pull-forward.
So first, do you think that your Q2 results included some pull-forwards and the second half should still be flattish?
And longer-term, after the Intel commentary regarding 18A maybe what that means is a knee-jerk reaction just
right away for AMD longer-term in terms share and ASPs?
LISA SU: Sure, Tom, thanks for the question. So first of all, our client and gaming segment, and particularly our client
business, just performed very well in the first half of the year. I think if you look at the entire first half, it was up
68% year-over-year.
I think if you look underneath that, what we're seeing is strength in every part of our client business. So we saw
very strong sales in our desktop channel area. We have a leadership product there, best gaming GPUs with our
X3D GPUs. We've had strong rise in AI adoption. As well in the first half of the year, we see that in sell-through.
And in addition, we've had strong enterprise sell-through as we brought that forward. So to your question of how
much is pull-forward, we don't think a whole lot of that is. When we look at the sell-through patterns, the end
user consumption is actually quite strong for client in terms of going into the second half of the year.
As we said in our Q3 guide, the primary driver of our Q3 guide is a very strong data center driven by MI350
ramping. We are expecting some growth in the client business, so I wouldn't say it'll be flat to the first half, but
we're planning for it to be a little bit less than seasonal, just given some of the uncertainties out there.
But the client business is performing extremely well for us. We believe we are gaining share in all the right
places. So if you look at the numbers in the first quarter, and it'll show through in the second quarter as well, a lot
of the uplift in revenue is in ASPs. And that is basically, we're selling up the stack on the strength of our portfolio.
And I think we're still quite underrepresented in the enterprise portion of the business. That is where we have
increased our go-to market resources and focus. And we're seeing nice traction there, especially with the
portfolios that we have from HP and Lenovo in enterprise PCs. And now we're adding Dell as well as it's ramping
here, started in the second quarter. We'll ramp more in the second half of the year.
So I think all of those are tailwinds for our client business, beyond the second half of '25, but really, into the next
number of quarters, as we think about the portfolio and the opportunities for us.
THOMAS
O'MALLEY:
Super helpful. And then secondly, I was hopeful you could provide us a little more color on China. So the guide
doesn't include MI308. But perhaps you could comment on when you get approval if the supply chain is ready,
what's currently in inventory, and maybe compare what you think the contribution will look like versus the $700
million in Q2 and the $800 million for the second half you spoke about in April.
LISA SU: Sure, Tom. So, yeah, let me answer some of the questions on China. I'm sure that there are some questions.
Look, we're very pleased with the progress that's been made with the administration over the last couple of
months. We've been working very closely with the administration. I think the focus here on ensuring that US
technology gets utilized throughout the world is something that we certainly support and very much want to
contribute to.
China's an important market for us. Given the timing of licenses, we have a number of licenses that are under
review now. We are working with the Department of Commerce to get those reviewed. We do expect that once
those licenses are approved, we will start MI308 shipments.
In terms of the supply chain, most of our inventory was not in finished goods, so it was work in process, and it will
take us a couple of quarters to run through that. The exact timing of revenue and contribution will depend a bit
on when the licenses are actually granted.
But overall, I think this is a better position than we were 90 days ago. And we certainly view China as a market
that we would like to service with MI308. And we're working closely with the administration to do that.
MODERATOR: And the next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed with
your question.
VIVEK ARYA: Thank you for taking my question. If we look into 2026, that's when I think the Sovereign opportunity could get
quite meaningful for AMD. What is the right way to size that? What does this JV structure mean with some of the
contracts that you have signed? And would you consider this incremental to the kind of growth rate that you're
seeing with your current MI business, or would this be instead of?
So just if you could give us a way to size, what is that incremental opportunity from a sovereign customers when
it comes to '26 , Lisa. Is it dependent on MI400? In which case, it might be more backup dated, et cetera. So just
some ways to think about Sovereign for AMD next year.
LISA SU: Yeah, absolutely, Vivek. Thanks for the question. So look, we're really excited about the overall AI opportunity for
us with MI355 and the MI400 series as we go through the back half of this year and into 2026. I think, there's a
very large opportunity with, let's call it hyperscalers, some of the leading AI companies, as well as Sovereign. I
think Sovereign is additive to that, for sure.
From the standpoint of what to expect, there are also some regulatory things that need to be worked through on
the Sovereign side. But again, we're working closely with the administration as they go through the various
regulatory decisions that need to be made.
But from my perspective, I think the fact that countries want their own Sovereign computing capability is very,
very clear. I think we see that all over the world. The humane opportunity that you're referring to that we
announced with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I think is a great example of where together with their ambitions,
our technology--
I think you heard from Tareq he was at our event-- saying that would start with MI355, that we would expect that
that would continue on. I think what's attractive about our offering is our open ecosystem. And I think that really
resonates with the Sovereign community. But to your original question, I think it's an additive opportunity, and
it's one that we believe will continue to be very important for us going forward with both MI355 as well as the
MI400 series.
VIVEK ARYA: Got it. And for my follow-up, I wanted to ask about gross margins for your MI product. So I understand in the early
days, right, it has been dilutive. What kind of sales level is required for it to start becoming additive to margins?
And let's say if I fast-forward to Q4 and assume that your Q4 sales are growing year-over-year roughly the same
rate as Q3 sales, should we expect gross margins to stay at these Q3 levels, or are there other plus/minus drivers
we should think about in terms of gross margins as you go into Q4? Thank you.
JEAN HU: Yeah, Vivek, thank you for the question. The gross margin of our MI product, we said it's a little bit below
corporate average. I think at this point, our priority is really to address the large, fast-growing revenue
opportunities we have and provide customers a better TCO to really expand our presence in the marketplace.
I think the way to think about our gross margin, there are different dynamics, different customers, different
generations. But also, our operations team has been continuing to really drive operational efficiency to improve
MI family's gross margin. That has been ongoing.
So it's not necessarily really tied to, OK, the revenue level each quarter, but you should think about it as a trend
in the longer term. It should improve continually going forward. Overall, the way I think about it is gross margin
dollars. This is one of the fastest-growing market opportunities. For any financial metrics, gross margin dollars is
what we try to grab as much as we can. Hopefully, that helped your question.
MODERATOR: And the next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
TIMOTHY
ARCURI:
Thanks a lot. So my question is on data center GPU. You did say that June is up year-over-year. So it sounds like
it's maybe a little more than $1 billion. And you use words like "strong ramp" into the back half of the year. Can
you give us just any color on what that means? Can you get to, say, $7 billion for the year? And can you give us
some maybe milepost on what you're assuming for Q3? That would be great.
LISA SU: Yeah, thanks, Tim, for the question. I think what we said in the prepared remarks is that we are seeing a strong
ramp from Q2 into Q3. MI355, we actually started production in June, so we had some shipments in the month of
June, but it really is ramping as we go through this quarter in the third quarter.
So in terms of guideposts, we said it would grow year-over-year from last year. And that I think is a strong ramp.
And then we would expect it to grow into the fourth quarter as well. The demand, I should say, what we're seeing
from customers is, I think really positive around MI355. The way I would contrast it with maybe the MI300 ramp.
I think MI300 started with perhaps some smaller deployments. I think what we're seeing with MI355 is very
competitive versus the B200, GB200 family of products. I think there's a strong desire to really use us at scale.
MI355 is very strong for inferencing. We're also working with a number of customers on training.
And this is also an opportunity for us to build into the MI400 series as we go into 2026. So we're bullish on MI355
and where the AI opportunity is for us. And I think we're right on track to what we expected to be as we were
going through the development of the roadmap.
TIMOTHY
ARCURI:
Thanks a lot. And then, Lisa, just on that point, also, you did talk about a new Developer Cloud. So obviously,
you're beginning to lease back some of the capacity that you're selling into the clouds and the NIO clouds.
Is that going to be a material portion of the revenue you're going to recognize for MI355 in the back half of the
year? Can you just talk about that and maybe how to think about how much demand that's going to stimulate
and what the ultimate goal is for that cloud? Thanks.
LISA SU: Yeah. So there are a couple of things in that question. So let me answer. So the Developer Cloud is simply we
want to make it super easy for developers to get on AMD Instinct GPUs. One could say-- again, if we look back at
the MI300 family, we were very focused on the largest hyperscalers and the largest customers.
But there's a lot of interest in our GPUs across a number of customers who just wanted easier access. So by
ensuring that Developer Cloud is there, that it has, ready-to-deploy containers, you can run training and
inference easily, you don't necessarily have to make longer-term commitments, I think that's the purpose of the
Developer Cloud.
I don't think it adds meaningfully to revenue in the second half of the year, but it certainly adds to customers
getting experience with AMD. I think the larger revenue opportunities for us are really with large customer
adoption as they ramp to larger deployments. And we're very actively trying to get those deployments up and
running as soon as possible.
One of the things, just as a reminder, that the MI355 is-- given that it's a similar infrastructure to MI300, we
actually think it's going to ramp very quickly and very well for customers. And I think that's one of the attractive
portions of it as well.
MODERATOR: And the next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your
question.
ROSS
SEYMORE:
Hi. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Lisa, I want to go back to the Instinct side of things, and the MI355
ramp. Looks like the second half is going to ramp really significantly. You said it's going to be up year-over-year in
the third quarter.
I believe a quarter ago, you said roughly the same thing in the MI308 is out of both numbers. So that shouldn't
really matter. And I guess it would be upside. But I just wondered how have things changed from a quarter ago as
far as the MI350 family adoption, especially because you launched a little bit early? Is the growth a little bit more
than you would have expected a quarter ago, about the same, or a little worse? Just any sort of color on that
would be helpful.
LISA SU: Yeah Ross, thanks for the question. I think the main thing I would say is I think the adoption is a bit faster than
we might have expected. Again, whenever you launch a product, we want to make sure that we go through the
full validation and all of that with our customers. I think there's a lot of interest, broad-based interest in MI355.
So I feel like over the last 90 days, I think we've had significant sort of new customer interest. And that's
certainly positive. I will say--
ROSS
SEYMORE:
I guess--
LISA SU: Oh, I'm sorry, Ross, I was just going to add, our engagements are-- I think the other piece is I think there's also a
lot of excitement around MI400 and what we can do with the Helios rack. So there are a number of customers
who, based on the strong roadmap that we're showing, want to get familiar and really work with us earlier in the
life cycle, which, I think, again, positive.
ROSS
SEYMORE:
Great. Thank you for that. I guess is my follow-up, an earlier question you talked about a little bit below
seasonality in the second half of the year for your client business. It seems like there's just-- I don't even know if
seasonality is a framework that matters.
But how are you thinking about that for the second half as a whole for client and then gaming? It was just up a
huge amount sequentially. In the second quarter, you described a little bit of what you're expecting there. But
how do you think about seasonality for the second half in its entirety in the gaming side as well?
LISA SU: Yeah. Let me try, and then Jean might add if you want a little bit more color. So the way to think about it is, we
do expect some sequential growth in client as we go into the third quarter. I would say single digit-type growth.
We continue to see good traction for our products in that portfolio.
On the gaming side, I would call it flattish to Q2. And we're coming off of such a strong Q2 that I think flattish is
actually to be expected. As we go into the fourth quarter, the dynamics that we would see is, we would see that
the console business would actually be down substantially. So think about it as down strong double digits.
The customers usually build for the holiday season, sort of before that. And then that will be completed by the
fourth quarter. So we would expect as the client and gaming segment that the segment would probably be down
in the fourth quarter. So hopefully, that helps. Jean, did you want to add to that?
JEAN HU: No, I think you covered it.
MODERATOR: And the next question comes from the line of Joshua Buckhalter with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your
question.
JOSHUA
BUCHALTER:
Hey, guys, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about lead times on the Instinct family, both for the
MI350 family and MI400. As you move into larger cluster sizes, which it sounds like you're doing at least with
Oracle on 350, and then endeavor to do more so on 400, how much visibility and lead time do you need from
your customers?
Because I would imagine the lead time for your parts is measured in months. But on the infrastructure side, in
particular for the larger-scale deployments, those things are measured in years at this point. So maybe you could
speak to the visibility specifically on the 400. Thank you.
LISA SU: Yes, sure, Josh. So, yes, our lead times are long, given all of the processing steps that we have to go through.
Think about it as somewhere between 8/9 months, that type of thing. We have a very, very strong supply chain.
We've been preparing for these ramps of both MI350 series and MI400 series. And that preparation is ongoing. So
we feel like we have a very strong supply chain there.
In terms of visibility with customers, we're absolutely working with customers very closely on near term MI350
series deployments, getting those deployments up as quickly as possible. Again, one of the things about the
MI350 series that is good is that it can go into existing data centers, just given the platform that is that it is in. So
we have been certainly working with our customers there.
And then for the MI400 series, there are lots and lots of details in of full rack scale design implementation. And
we're actively working with the largest customers right now on just ensuring that our Helios rack is fully
compatible with their data center build out as we go into 2026.
So that visibility is important. I think that co-development, co-engineering is important as we get into the rack
scale architecture. And the team that we've brought in has been extremely, extremely helpful in terms of both
internal platform build out, as well as ensuring that we're working closely with our customers on their data center
needs.
JOSHUA
BUCHALTER:
Thank you for that, Lisa. And maybe for Jean, I wanted to follow up on Vivek's question earlier on gross margins.
So if we add back the charges in 2Q and then your gross margin implied in the guidance is roughly flat
sequentially, and that's despite what's implied to be data center GPUs up meaningfully, sequentially.
It doesn't seem like consoles falling off in the third quarter. Can you maybe talk to the underlying drivers of how
you're able to keep the flat gross margins despite what sounds like still margin-dilutive data center GPUs up
significantly within the mix? Thank you.
JEAN HU: Yeah, Josh, thanks for the question. Yeah, we are guiding our Q3 gross margin around 54% and Q2 , you're right,
excluding the $800 million charge. It was close to 54%. I think the gaming business actually is quite high. So the
mix actually is unfavorable.
But we do have some tailwinds we have been really driving. First is we have been expanding our server business,
which has really nice gross margin. And on the client business side, we are expanding the commercial PC
business. That really helps us to drive the gross margin up.
In addition, we do have a really strong operational team. They are driving the gross margin improvement just
from an operational efficiency perspective across the board. So overall, our objective is to continue to improve
gross margin. Despite MI350 very strong ramp in Q3, we are able to continue to drive the margin up.
MODERATOR: And the next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
JOE MOORE: Great. Thank you. You used this language before of the kind of 10's of billions opportunity around MI400. Can you
talk about the time frame when that might occur, and not to pin you down too much, and what would help you
get to that level sooner rather than later? Should we think of that 2027 realistic outcome that you could be
looking at $20 billion-plus? Just a little bit more color on that 10's of billions comment.
LISA SU: Yeah. Maybe without being specific, Joe, I can give you the way I look at it and back to this notion of, are we
incrementally more confident? I think we're seeing a lot of positive signs in our AI customer adoption. I think the
strength of the MI350 series, the very positive feedback that we're getting on MI400 from customers, the work
that we're doing in terms of ensuring that we are fully ready for large-scale deployments of not just inference but
training.
I think when we get to 10's of billions of dollars, we're talking about significant gigawatt-scale type deployments.
And those would be important for us to get there. And we're certainly, I think, engaged with all the right
customers that can enable that type of ramp. But I won't necessarily speculate on the exact time other than to
say certainly, that would be our set of aspirations.
JOE MOORE: Great that's helpful. Thank you. And then, as these workloads evolve-- you've talked about inference and training
as different opportunities for AMD. Are you seeing those start to come together? It seems like with inference, the
reasoning models are requiring much higher complexity. Is rack scale more important to the inference market
than you thought it might be? Just any color around how that complexity of inference is impacting you guys.
LISA SU: Yeah, I think that's absolutely true, Joe. With the proliferation of models, I think what we're seeing is GPUs
continue to be the computing of choice as you think about all the models that are out there. And then as you go
into distributed inference and some of the newer techniques, we are seeing the importance of the scale-up and
scale-out architecture, which we are, investing in.
But I think the overarching thing is, I think we have a very competitive roadmap across the next couple of
generations. I think that has now gotten strong customer validation. We're getting a lot of feedback from
customers on where they would like to see us continue to add more resources and add more focus. So that is
very helpful. And the key is to be a full-scale solution provider for these large customer deployments. And that's
what we're working on.
MODERATOR: And the next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
AARON
RAKERS:
Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I do have a follow-up as well. I guess the first question is, when we look at
the data center guide, Jean, you alluded to double-digit sequential growth. Obviously, the MI355 series kind of
ramping. I'm curious, how could we conceptualize what you're expecting in the server side, and where do you
think your market share is today in traditional enterprise servers outside of cloud?
JEAN HU: Yeah, I think when you look at our data center business, we do have a strong double-digit growth. Both server
and the MI, both sides are growing sequentially. Of course, MI ramp is the most significant one. As far as server
market share, we do think we continue to drive the market share up compared to Q1. Third party has not
published report yet, but we feel really good about the Q2 market share increase versus Q1.
LISA SU: And Aaron, if I just add to that, one of the things that-- it's important for people to understand is, in some of the
cloud CapEx numbers that have come out that have been quite positive, that is not only a GPU statement, but
there's actually significant CPU CapEx in there as well.
We've started to see more robust forecasts going out a number of quarters on the server CPU side, because all of
that AI content really requires traditional CPUs as well. So we're very bullish on the opportunity in servers. I think
the team has really executed extremely well.
If you look at our portfolio now, Turin Genoa, our very well-adopted broadening workloads. Enterprise adoption is
also increasing. So I think all of those are positive for the server opportunity in the second half of '25, as well as
going into '26 and beyond.
AARON
RAKERS:
Yeah. And then as a follow-up, I'm thinking about the China, the MI308 opportunity. When we do see a license-- I
think you alluded to this earlier-- it's going to take a little bit of time to ramp and get the supply chain to satisfy
the demand. But I'm curious, the $800 million writedown that you had taken, is there no kind of finished
inventory there? Does that come back? Do you have any reversal aspects of that once a license gets approved?
JEAN HU: Let me start first, then Lisa can add. The first on the $800 million. Majority of them are WIPs We really don't have
on the shelf finished good we can ship immediately. So we do need to take time if we get a license.
AARON
RAKERS:
Thank you.
MODERATOR: And the next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.
CJ MUSE: Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Lisa, I was hoping you could level-set us on the
Instinct ramp into 2026. How are you thinking about the timing of the handoff 350 to 400? How are you thinking
about Helios contributions. And I guess very importantly, from a customer contribution perspective, how you
might see that evolve from traditional hyperscalers to perhaps more sovereign and NIO cloud within the mix?
LISA SU: Sure, CJ. So certainly, as second half this year, it's all about MI355 ramp into first half of next year, I think the
MI400 series development is right on track. The development of the Helios platform is also right on track. We
would expect significant revenue contribution from Helios in 2026.
And then relative to the contribution of the various things, hyperscalers, versus NIO clouds versus Sovereign, I
think it's a little early to really talk about the different pieces other than to say, you would expect that
hyperscalers and let's call it NIO clouds that would be working for other large AI natives, maybe significant pieces
of the initial ramp. And then Sovereign may come a little bit later in time, just given the timing of when different
build-outs would happen. So hopefully, that gives you some color.
CJ MUSE: Very helpful. And then, Jean, I guess a question for you, with the sale of ZT for $3 million in cash and stock, and
you only have $3 billion of debt outstanding, how are you thinking about the use of proceeds? Is there saving for
a rainy day or bolt on acquisitions, perhaps more aggressive share buyback? How are you thinking about it
today?
JEAN HU: Yeah, thanks for the question. Our business model actually generates a lot of free cash flow. As you see in Q2,
free cash flow generation was $1.2 billion. So if we close the ZT sale, and we'll get more cash. Overall, our capital
allocation principle continues to be the first phase investing, especially with the tremendous opportunities ahead
of us.
And then we will continue to return cash to shareholders. We did a $1.2 billion repurchase in the first half of the
year. We are committed to continue to return cash to shareholders through share repurchase.
MATTHEW
RAMSAY:
Operator, I think we have time for one more caller, please.
MODERATOR: The final question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.
BEN REITZES: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in here. I wanted to clarify a little bit on the $1 billion increase in sequential sales.
It would seem like it's coming from GPUs, primarily. I was wondering if you could back that. And that's with
nothing in China.
And if the answer to the prior question that GPUs are over a billion, that kind of puts you at a $2 billion run rate.
And I was just wondering if that was accurate in terms of thinking. And then I have just a very quick follow-up.
Thanks.
JEAN HU: Hi, Ben, thanks for the question. If you look at the sequential revenue increase, as I mentioned during the
prepared remarks, we see data center strong double-digit increase, which includes both GPU and CPU. But GPU
definitely drives the largest incremental amount increase. We also mentioned the client actually is going to
increase sequentially.
In addition, the embedded business will return to sequential growth. So multiple businesses contributed to
sequential increase, but the majority of increase really driven by MI355's strong ramp.
BEN REITZES: Great. And then if indeed that gets you pretty close to a couple billion dollars, if the MI300 comes in, do you see it
at the same run rate that you exited and then you have the ability to get at that $800 mill run rate right away?
Or do you think it'll take several quarters to ramp when you get the license? Thanks.
LISA SU: Yeah, Ben, it will take some time to ramp, just given-- particularly, today, we're sitting already in early August so
I don't think you would see a lot of it in Q3. But certainly, as licenses would be approved, we would schedule that,
and it would take a little while to ramp.
MATTHEW
RAMSAY:
All right, operator. Thank you very much. We appreciate everybody that joined the call today. And we just like to
end the call now. Thank you.
MODERATOR: Yes, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation. You
may disconnect your lines at this time.
