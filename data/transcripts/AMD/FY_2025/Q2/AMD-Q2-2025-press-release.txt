AMD Reports Second Quarter 2025 Financial Results
SANTA CLARA, Calif. ― August 5, 2025 ― AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) today announced
financial results for the second quarter of 2025. Second quarter revenue was a record $7.7
billion, gross margin was 40%, operating loss was $134 million, net income was $872 million
and diluted earnings per share was $0.54. On a non-GAAP(*) basis, gross margin was 43%,
operating income was $897 million, net income was $781 million and diluted earnings per share
was $0.48. As previously announced, our second quarter results were impacted by the U.S.
Government's export control on our AMD Instinct™ MI308 data center GPU products. For the
quarter, these restrictions led to approximately $800 million in inventory and related charges.
Excluding these charges, non-GAAP gross margin would have been approximately 54%.
“We delivered strong revenue growth in the second quarter led by record server and PC
processor sales,” said Dr. Lisa Su, AMD Chair and CEO. “We are seeing robust demand across
our computing and AI product portfolio and are well positioned to deliver significant growth in the
second half of the year, driven by the ramp of our AMD Instinct MI350 series accelerators and
ongoing EPYC and Ryzen processor share gains.”
“We achieved 32% year-over-year revenue growth and generated record free cash flow this
quarter, reflecting our disciplined execution,” said Jean Hu, AMD EVP, CFO and Treasurer. “Our
strategic investments across hardware, software and systems position us well to support robust
future growth and drive long-term shareholder value.”

Segment Summary
• Data Center segment revenue was $3.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year primarily driven
by strong demand for AMD EPYC™ processors more than offsetting headwinds
impacting AMD Instinct MI308 shipments to China.
• Client and Gaming segment revenue was $3.6 billion, up 69% year-over-year. Client
revenue was a record $2.5 billion, up 67% year-over-year primarily driven by strong
demand for the latest “Zen 5” AMD Ryzen™ desktop processors and a richer product
mix. Gaming revenue was $1.1 billion, up 73% year-over-year driven by an increase in
semi-custom revenue and strong AMD Radeon™ GPU demand.
• Embedded segment revenue was $824 million, down 4% year-over-year as demand in
end markets remained mixed.

(*) In this earnings press release, in addition to GAAP financial results, AMD has provided non-GAAP financial measures including nonGAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses/revenue percent, nonGAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. AMD uses a
normalized tax rate in its computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision to provide better consistency across the reporting periods.
For fiscal 2025, AMD used a non-GAAP tax rate of 13%, which excludes the tax impact of pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments. Additionally,
AMD has provided an adjusted non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin which excludes the inventory and related charges associated
with U.S. export restrictions. AMD also provides adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and free cash flow margin as supplemental nonGAAP measures of its performance. These items are defined in the footnotes to the selected corporate data tables provided at the end
of this earnings press release. AMD is providing these financial measures because it believes this non-GAAP presentation makes it
easier for investors to compare its operating results for current and historical periods and also because AMD believes it assists
investors in comparing AMD’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that it does not believe
are indicative of its core operating performance and for the other reasons described in the footnotes to the selected data tables. The
non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this earnings press release should be viewed in addition to and not as a substitute for or
superior to AMD’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with AMD’s Consolidated
Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures referenced are reconciled to their most
directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the data tables in this earnings press release. This earnings press release also
contains forward-looking non-GAAP gross margin concerning AMD’s financial outlook, which is based on current expectations as of
August 5, 2025, and assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Adjustments to arrive at the GAAP gross
margin outlook typically include stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related and
other costs. The timing and impact of such adjustments are dependent on future events that are typically uncertain or outside of AMD's
control, therefore, a reconciliation to equivalent GAAP measures is not practicable at this time. AMD undertakes no intent or obligation
to publicly update or revise its outlook statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required
by law.

Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,088 $ 1,954 $ 1,430 $ 3,042 $ 2,725
The Company presents “Adjusted EBITDA” as a supplemental measure of its performance. Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by
adjusting GAAP net income for interest expense, other (income) expense, net, income tax provision (benefit), equity income in investee, stockbased compensation, depreciation and amortization expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, inventory loss at contract
manufacturer, acquisition-related and other costs, restructuring charges, and income from discontinued operations, net of tax. The Company
calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital
structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists
investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are
indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of
this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating
measure of net income or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA
does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flows.

Free cash flow margin % 15 % 10 % 8 % 13 % 7 %
The Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by adjusting
GAAP net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for capital expenditures, and free cash flow margin % is free cash flow
expressed as a percentage of the Company's net revenue. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings
press release because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s
calculation of free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors
should not view free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities.
