Net income was $872 million (GAAP), diluted EPS $0.54. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin was 43%, operating income $897 million, non-GAAP EPS $0.48. The quarter was impacted by U.S. export controls on the AMD Instinct MI308, resulting in approx. $800 million inventory/related charges. Data Center revenue was $3.2 billion (+14% YoY), Client & Gaming revenue was $3.6 billion (+69% YoY), Embedded revenue $824 million (-4% YoY).

Gross margin fell to 40% GAAP (43% non-GAAP) and would have been ~54% absent the export-control headwind. Data Center revenue of ~$3.2 billion grew 14%, while Client & Gaming revenue of ~$3.6 billion grew 69%. Embedded revenue declined ~4% to ~$824 million. AMD’s outlook calls for ~ $8.7 billion in revenue for Q3, underscoring strong demand in compute and AI segments but highlighting China/regulatory risk associated with GPU exports.",

Non-GAAP EPS of $0.48 met expectations but disappointed some investors because gross margin fell significantly due to export-control charges tied to China shipments of MI308 GPUs. The market reaction was muted/negative, reflecting concerns about margin degradation, China regulatory risk, and how fast the MI350/MI355 AI accelerator ramp will unfold. CEO Lisa Su reinforced the company’s long-term AI and compute strategy, but analysts pressed on timeline and competitive positioning versus peers.",

The analysis suggests that the ramp of the next-generation MI350/MI355 series, clarity around export licences for China, and margin recovery are essential for sustaining the company’s compute-/AI-driven growth narrative. Additionally, while EPYC server CPUs and Ryzen client/gaming chips delivered strong growth, the embedded segment declined and remains a drag. For RAG use cases, this quarter illustrates how AMD is executing on compute share gains yet remains exposed to geo-regulatory, margin-compression and competitive risks in the AI accelerator market.",
