Meta Reports Third Quarter 2025 Results
MENLO PARK, Calif. – October 29, 2025 – Meta Platforms, Inc. (Nasdaq: META) today reported financial results for the
quarter ended September 30, 2025.
"We had a strong quarter for our business and our community," said Mark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO. "Meta
Superintelligence Labs is off to a great start and we continue to lead the industry in AI glasses. If we deliver even a fraction of the
opportunity ahead, then the next few years will be the most exciting period in our history."

Provision for Income Taxes - One-Time, Non-Cash Charge Impact
We expect a significant reduction in our U.S. federal cash tax payments for the remainder of 2025 and future years due to the
implementation of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. However, the implementation also led to the recognition of a valuation
allowance against our U.S. federal deferred tax assets, reflecting the impact of the U.S. Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax. As a
result, the third quarter 2025 provision for income taxes includes a one-time, non-cash income tax charge of $15.93 billion.
Excluding this one-time tax charge, our third quarter 2025:
• Effective tax rate would have decreased by 73 percentage points to 14%, compared to the reported effective tax rate of
87%.
• Net income would have increased by $15.93 billion to $18.64 billion, compared to the reported net income of $2.71
billion.
• Diluted EPS would have increased by $6.20 to $7.25, compared to the reported diluted EPS of $1.05.
Third Quarter 2025 Operational and Other Financial Highlights
• Family daily active people (DAP) – DAP was 3.54 billion on average for September 2025, an increase of 8% year-overyear.
• Ad impressions – Ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps increased by 14% year-over-year.
• Average price per ad – Average price per ad increased by 10% year-over-year.
• Revenue – Revenue was $51.24 billion, an increase of 26% year-over-year. Revenue on a constant currency basis would
have increased 25% year-over-year.
• Costs and expenses – Total costs and expenses were $30.71 billion, an increase of 32% year-over-year.

$10.62 billion.

CFO Outlook Commentary
We expect fourth quarter 2025 total revenue to be in the range of $56-59 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is an
approximately 1% tailwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates. Our outlook reflects an
expectation for continued strong ad revenue growth, partially offset by lower year-over-year Reality Labs revenue in the fourth
quarter. The anticipated reduction in Reality Labs revenue is due to us lapping the introduction of Quest 3S in the fourth quarter
of last year as well as retail partners procuring Quest headsets during the third quarter of this year to prepare for the holiday
season, which were recorded as revenue in the third quarter.
We expect full year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of $116-118 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $114-118 billion
and reflecting a growth rate of 22-24% year-over-year.
We currently expect 2025 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be in the range of $70-72
billion, increased from our prior outlook of $66-72 billion.
Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2025 tax rate to be 12-15%.
We are at an exciting point for our company, where we have continued runway to improve our core services today as well as the
opportunity to build new AI-powered experiences and services that will transform how people engage with our products in the
future. We expect the set of investments we are making within our ads and organic engagement initiatives next year will enable us
to continue to deliver strong revenue growth in 2026, while our progress on AI models and products will position us to capitalize
on new revenue opportunities in the years to come.
A central requirement to realizing these opportunities is infrastructure capacity. As we have begun to plan for next year, it has
become clear that our compute needs have continued to expand meaningfully, including versus our expectations last quarter. We
are still working through our capacity plans for next year, but we expect to invest aggressively to meet these needs both by
building our own infrastructure and contracting with third party cloud providers. We anticipate this will provide further upward
pressure on our capital expenditures and expense plans next year.
As a result, our current expectation is that capital expenditures dollar growth will be notably larger in 2026 than 2025. We also
anticipate total expenses will grow at a significantly faster percentage rate in 2026 than 2025, with growth driven primarily by
infrastructure costs, including incremental cloud expenses and depreciation. Employee compensation costs will be the second
largest contributor to growth, as we recognize a full year of compensation for employees hired throughout 2025, particularly AI
talent, and add technical talent in priority areas.
Finally, we continue to monitor active legal and regulatory matters, including the increasing headwinds in the EU and the U.S.
that could significantly impact our business and financial results. For example, in the EU, we continue to engage constructively
with the European Commission on our Less Personalized Ads offering. However, we cannot rule out the Commission imposing
further changes to that offering that could have a significant negative impact on our European revenue, as early as this quarter. In
the U.S., a number of youth-related trials are scheduled for 2026, and may ultimately result in a material loss.

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business plans and expectations. These forwardlooking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the
impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability
to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile
operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies
that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new
business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and Reality Labs efforts; our emphasis on community growth
and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation;
our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated
with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries;
litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with
acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or
other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results
to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption "Risk Factors" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
filed with the SEC on July 31, 2025, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.atmeta.com and on the SEC
website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
September 30, 2025. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October 29, 2025, and any forward-looking
statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation
to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.
For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled "Limitations of
Key Metrics and Other Data" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue
excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of
these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information
prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the
use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial
measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by
providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.
We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial
performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of
business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our
business.
Our non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:
Foreign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 using the
prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful
metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.
Purchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and
equipment, and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items
collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we
procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental
information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our
residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.
For more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, see the
"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results" table in this press release.

Family Daily Active People (DAP)
 In Billions
10
We define a daily active person (DAP) as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp (collectively, our "Family" of products) who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device
application or using a web or mobile browser on a given day. The numbers for DAP do not include users on our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as DAP based on their other activities on our Family products.
We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of
DAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual
product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on
internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. For additional information, see "Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data" located in
the Appendix of this presentation. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023, our Family metrics no longer include Messenger Kids users.

Free cash flow (FCF) is a non-GAAP financial measure that has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by
operating activities. FCF is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses. Some of the limitations of FCF are: (i) FCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments, and (ii) other companies in
our industry present similarly titled measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. 
Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data
16
Family Metrics
The numbers for our key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts. We report our estimates of the numbers of our daily active people (DAP) and
average revenue per person (ARPP) (collectively, our "Family metrics") based on the activity of users who visited at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp (collectively, our
"Family" of products) during the applicable period of measurement.
While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our
products across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these metrics require significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other
technical errors. In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology. We regularly
review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in adjustments to
our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments. We
generally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below.
In addition, our Family metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology or other factors such as data limitations or other challenges in
measuring large online and mobile populations. For example, our methodologies include measurements of our user base that have in some instances exceeded estimates of addressable online and
mobile populations that are based on data published by third parties.
Many people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual product. Accordingly, for our Family metrics,
we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our community. Rather, our Family metrics represent our
estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use
multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. To calculate these metrics, we rely upon complex
techniques, algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user accounts within an individual product and
across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. These techniques and models require significant judgment, are
subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are subject to statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user
survey data as described further below, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family metrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin
generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide DAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the
actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics
may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.
Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data
17
To calculate our estimates of DAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user
survey data. We apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example, to match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products,
we use data signals such as similar device information, IP addresses, and user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our
products, which survey questions are based on monthly usage, and which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the
future contribute, to changes in our reported Family metrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the
risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more limited data signals for some products
compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer data signals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device
information to match WhatsApp user accounts with accounts on our other products. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our
own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported Family
metrics, as well as our ability to report these metrics at all. Our estimates of Family metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or
technologies, product changes, or other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or machine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or
otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In addition, such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).
We regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our DAP consisting solely of "violating" accounts. We define "violating" accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to
be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we estimated that less than 3% of our worldwide DAP consisted solely of violating
accounts. Such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, we look for account
information and behaviors associated with Facebook and Instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have limited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to
encryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts, we do not include such person in our violating accounts estimation as long as we believe they have one
account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts
among our users, which may also reduce our DAP estimates in a particular period. We intend to continue to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our DAP consisting solely of violating accounts
on an annual basis. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.
User Geography
Our estimates for revenue by user location, as well as year-over-year percentage changes in ad impressions delivered and the average price per ad by user location, are also affected by data
limitations and other challenges in measuring user geography. Our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors, such as the user's IP address and
self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user's actual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing our products from the location of the proxy server
that the user connects to rather than from the user's actual location. The methodologies used to measure our metrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors.
