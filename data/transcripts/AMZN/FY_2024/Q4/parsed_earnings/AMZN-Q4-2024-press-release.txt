“The holiday shopping season was the most successful yet for Amazon and we appreciate the support of our customers, selling
partners, and employees who helped make it so,” said Andy Jassy, President and CEO, Amazon. “When we look back on this
quarter several years from now, I suspect what we’ll most remember is the remarkable innovation delivered across all of our
businesses, none more so than in AWS where we introduced our new Trainium2 AI chip, our own foundation models in
Amazon Nova, a plethora of new models and features in Amazon Bedrock that give customers flexibility and cost savings,
liberating transformations in Amazon Q to migrate from old platforms, and the next edition of Amazon SageMaker to pull data,
analytics, and AI together more concertedly. These benefits are often realized by customers (and the business) several months
down the road, but these are substantial enablers in this emerging technology environment and we’re excited to see what
customers build.”

Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of February 6, 2025, and are subject to
substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and
spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events,
the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors
detailed below.
First Quarter 2025 Guidance
• Net sales are expected to be between $151.0 billion and $155.5 billion, or to grow between 5% and 9% compared with
first quarter 2024. This guidance anticipates an unusually large, unfavorable impact of approximately $2.1 billion, or
150 basis points, from foreign exchange rates. Also, as a reminder, in first quarter 2024 the impact from Leap Year
added approximately $1.5 billion in net sales.
• Operating income is expected to be between $14.0 billion and $18.0 billion, compared with $15.3 billion in first
quarter 2024.
• This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal
settlements are concluded.
Conference Call Information
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:00 p.m. PT/5:00 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s
financial and operating results.
Forward-Looking Statements
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation,
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products,
services, and technologies, security incidents, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition,
global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give
rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial
results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent
Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
