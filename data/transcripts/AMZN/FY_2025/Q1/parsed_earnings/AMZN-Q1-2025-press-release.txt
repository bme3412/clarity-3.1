Trainium2 chips and Bedrock model expansion that make it easier for AWS customers to train models and run inference more
flexibly and cost-effectively, to our first Project Kuiper satellites successfully launching into low earth orbit in our quest to
provide broadband access to hundreds of millions of households in rural areas without it today—we’re continuing to find
meaningful ways to make customers’ lives easier and better every day.”
Some other highlights since the company’s last earnings announcement include that Amazon:

Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of May 1, 2025, and are subject to substantial
uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, tariff and trade policies, and customer demand
and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world
events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various
factors detailed below.
Second Quarter 2025 Guidance
• Net sales are expected to be between $159.0 billion and $164.0 billion, or to grow between 7% and 11% compared
with second quarter 2024. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 10 basis points from
foreign exchange rates.
• Operating income is expected to be between $13.0 billion and $17.5 billion, compared with $14.7 billion in second
quarter 2024.
• This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal
settlements are concluded.
Conference Call Information
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:00 p.m. PT/5:00 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s
financial and operating results.
Forward-Looking Statements
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation,
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products,
services, and technologies, security incidents, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition,
global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give
rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial
results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent
Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

technology alliance or marketing and promotional relationship. Customers are considered active when they have
placed an order during the preceding twelve-month period.
Seller Accounts

eligible to use AWS services. This includes AWS accounts in the AWS free tier. Multiple users accessing AWS
services via one account ID are counted as a single account. Customers are considered active when they have had
AWS usage activity during the preceding one-month period.

Q1 2025 Financial Results
Conference Call Slides
2
This presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are inherently difficult to predict.
Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others,
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions, tariff and trade policies,
and customer demand and spending, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world
events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging
technologies, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of
those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from
products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition,
management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion,
the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment,
sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand,
the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements,
proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment
throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new
products, services, and technologies, security incidents, system interruptions, government regulation
and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or
unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks.
More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included
in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), including its most recent
Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Additional information relating to certain of our financial measures contained herein, including nonGAAP financial measures, is available in the appendix to our presentation, our most recent earnings
release and at our website at www.amazon.com/ir.
