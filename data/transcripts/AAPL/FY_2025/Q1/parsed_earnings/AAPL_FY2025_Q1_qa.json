          "content": "We saw that markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence performed better year-over-year on the iPhone 16 family than those where it was not available. Users are utilizing all features, from Writing Tools to Image Playground and Genmoji. We only had about two and a half weeks of the second release in the quarter, but early indications are positive."

        {
          "topic": "China Performance",
          "content": "Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year. Over half of this decline was driven by a change in channel inventory from the beginning to the end of the quarter. We have not rolled out Apple Intelligence in China yet. However, it remains the most competitive market in the world. We are seeing fiscal stimulus occurring recently."

          "content": "Innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing. Our tight integration of silicon and software serves us well. We use a hybrid model with on-device processing and private cloud compute. We've always been prudent with capital expenditure and will continue to leverage this hybrid model."

          "topic": "iPhone Upgraders",
          "content": "We set an all-time record for upgraders, and the install base hit a new all-time high. The iPhone 16 has outperformed the iPhone 15 in the period from launch to the end of the December quarter. Markets with Apple Intelligence outperformed those without."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Emerging Markets",
          "content": "We have great results in emerging markets. India set a December quarter record, and iPhone was the top-selling model there. We are opening four new stores in India. We have modest share in these huge markets, so there is lots of upside."

          "topic": "AI Adoption and Features",
          "content": "I believe Apple Intelligence will go mainstream. As the base of compatible devices (iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 lineup) grows, usage will grow. Features like summarization are becoming indispensable. We are rolling out more languages in April."

          "content": "We are guiding to 46.5% to 47.5% for the March quarter. We expect FX headwinds to impact margins sequentially, but this will be offset by favorable costs and services mix. We lose some leverage moving from Q1 to Q2, but we feel the guidance range is very strong."

Transacting and paid accounts reached all-time highs, with over 1 billion paid subscriptions. We are focused on improving the breadth and quality of offerings."
