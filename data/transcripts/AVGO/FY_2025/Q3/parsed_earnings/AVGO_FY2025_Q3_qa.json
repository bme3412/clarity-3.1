We have secured over $10 billion of orders for AI accelerators from a fourth qualified customer, which will ship strongly in beginning of 2026. Demand from the existing 3 customers continues to grow. We expect the outlook for fiscal 2026 AI revenue to improve significantly."

We launched Tomahawk 6 (102.4T Ethernet switch) which flattens networks to 2 tiers, and Jericho4 (51.2T Ethernet fabric router) for scaling across data centers beyond 200,000 compute nodes. We believe Ethernet is applicable to scale-up, scale-out, and scale-across challenges."

In Q4, we forecast non-AI semiconductor revenue to grow low double digits sequentially to ~$4.6 billion driven by seasonality."
