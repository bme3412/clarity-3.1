          "content": "Q2 2025 revenue was a record $15 billion, up 20% YoY (all organic). Adjusted EBITDA was $10 billion, up 35% YoY. Semiconductor revenue was $8.4 billion, up 17% YoY, driven by AI revenue of over $4.4 billion (up 46% YoY). Custom AI accelerators grew double digits YoY, while AI networking grew over 170% YoY and represented 40% of AI revenue."

          "topic": "AI Growth and Outlook",
          "content": "We expect fiscal 2025 growth rate of AI semiconductor revenue to sustain into fiscal 2026. We forecast AI semiconductor revenue to be $5.1 billion in Q3, up 60% YoY. We see acceleration of demand into the back half of 2026 to meet urgent demand for inference on top of training."

          "topic": "Infrastructure Software",
          "content": "Infrastructure software revenue was $6.6 billion, up 25% YoY. VCF (VMware Cloud Foundation) adoption is strong, with over 87% of our 10,000 largest customers now adopting it. ARR growth is double digits. We expect Q3 Infrastructure software revenue to be approximately $6.7 billion, up 16% YoY."

          "topic": "Non-AI Semiconductors",
          "content": "Non-AI semiconductor revenue was $4 billion, down 5% YoY. Broadband, enterprise networking, and server storage revenues were up sequentially in Q2. Industrial and wireless were down. For Q3, we expect non-AI semiconductor revenue to stay around $4 billion."

          "topic": "AI Clusters and Networking",
          "content": "We expect at least 3 customers to deploy 1 million AI-accelerated clusters in 2027. AI networking is robust, with Ethernet remaining the preferred choice for hyperscale customers. We announced a next-gen 102.4T Tomahawk switch enabling clusters of >100k accelerators in just 2 tiers."

          "topic": "Inference vs Training",
          "content": "Hyperscalers are doubling down on inference to monetize their platforms. We are seeing much more inference now, which is driving acceleration in demand. There is no differentiation between training and inference in using merchant vs custom accelerators; custom allows optimizing software algorithms to hardware for higher performance."

          "topic": "Scale-Up Networking",
          "content": "Scale-up is rapidly converting to Ethernet. As clusters get larger (beyond 72 GPU-to-GPU interconnects), we expect a push towards optical interconnects to replace copper, potentially using co-packaged optics or pluggable optics."

          "topic": "Gross Margin Impact",
