          "content": "We have 3 hyperscale customers shipping in volume today. Beyond that, we have deeply engaged with 4 additional hyperscalers (partners) to develop custom accelerators to train their next-generation frontier models. These 4 are not included in our estimated SAM of $60B-$90B in fiscal 2027. These engagements take time; typically 1.5 years from engagement to the first chip, and another 6 months to a year to reach scale production."

          "content": "Non-AI semiconductor revenue was $4.1B in Q1, down 9% sequentially due to seasonal wireless decline. Broadband showed double-digit sequential recovery from a bottom in Q4 '24. Server storage expected to be up high single digits in Q2. Enterprise networking remains flattish working through inventory. Wireless expected to be flat YoY in Q2."

Growth driven by converting perpetual licenses to subscriptions (over 60% done) and upselling to full stack VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF). 70% of our largest 10,000 customers have adopted VCF. VCF also enables on-prem AI workloads via VMware Private AI Foundation (39 customers)."

          "topic": "Networking vs. Compute Mix",
          "content": "In Q1, there was a surge in networking, shifting the mix slightly, but the long-term norm within our AI revenue is approximately 70% XPUs (accelerators) and 30% connectivity/networking. Networking is driven by performance (Ethernet, optical) to scale out clusters."
