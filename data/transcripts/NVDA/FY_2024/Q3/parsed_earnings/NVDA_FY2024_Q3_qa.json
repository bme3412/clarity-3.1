          "content": "AI is driving a multibillion-dollar demand surge. We raised supply each quarter, ramped HGX with Hopper, shipping H200/H200G, and are delivering InfiniBand networking and Spectrum-X Ethernet to scale AI factories globally, including sovereign clouds."

          "topic": "China/export control impact",
          "content": "China/affected regions accounted for ~20-25% of data center revenue. Q4 guidance assumes those shipments drop significantly, though we are engaging on regulation-compliant SKUs; supply increases elsewhere can more than offset the reduction."
