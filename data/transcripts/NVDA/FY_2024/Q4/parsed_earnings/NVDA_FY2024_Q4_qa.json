          "topic": "Capex & Demand Signals",
          "content": "Our capex is tied to the demand signal. We manage land/data center builds over decades while kit purchases are driven by inferencing and analytic demand. Right now the product mix (consumer/Commercial SaaS/AI meters) is healthy, so we continue to expand with flexibility, but spend only when customers are ready to deploy."

          "content": "Azure is a port of call for nearly every AI project, with vector databases and Fabric tying into search, Cosmos DB, dev tools, and migrations. Copilot Studio lets enterprises ground copilots in SaaS data; we orchestrate the broader Copilot stack across ServiceNow, SAP, Salesforce and Dynamics."

          "topic": "Roadmap & ecosystem",
          "content": "Our computing platform remains aligned with the multi-cloud ecosystem. We keep architectural compatibility while delivering new innovations—HGX, TensorRT LLM, Spectrum-X, H200, Grace Hopper—so every CSP, OEM, and industry vertical can adopt without retooling their stack."

          "topic": "OpEx efficiency & margins",
