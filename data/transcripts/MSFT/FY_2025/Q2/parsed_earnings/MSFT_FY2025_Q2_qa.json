But again, we were a little bit disappointed on Azure coming in at the bottom end of the guidance range. Amy, I was hoping you could dig into perhaps what some of those execution issues were, what the resolution to those issues were? And do we still feel comfortable in the acceleration into the back half of the year that you were talking about after the June quarter and after last quarter?"

And our estimates are that the Copilot was much bigger than we had expected and growing much faster. Any more details on the breakdown of what that Microsoft AI beat would be great."

        "Maybe this one is well for Satya, and it's also away from the numbers. But Satya, I wanted to ask you about the Stargate news and the announced changes in the OpenAI relationship last week. It seems that most of your investors have interpreted this as Microsoft, for sure, remaining very committed to OpenAI's success, but electing to take more of a backseat in terms of funding OpenAI's future training CapEx needs. I was hoping you might frame your strategic decision here around Stargate, and Amy, whether there's any takeaway for investors from that decision in terms of how you're thinking about CapEx needs over the next several years."

Satya, as we think about Microsoft's very rich Copilot portfolio, now having been in market for over a year, with the products and precision only getting better and the cost of inference coming down, how do you think about the journey from here and perhaps the ability to package and evolve the go-to-market to address the broadest range of customers and customer requirements out there?"

        "Wonderful. Great to hear about the strength you're seeing in Copilot. Would love to get some color as to where you're seeing that strength. Is it departmental deals, customers moving from proof of concept to departmental deals, maybe multiple departmental deals in the enterprise? And you mentioned some uptick in usage trends. Would love to get some color on just the common use cases that you're seeing that give you that confidence that, that will ramp into monetization later."

        "I wanted to go back to commercial bookings. Commercial RPO, I think, increased $39 billion sequentially. That's the most we've ever seen on a sequential basis. Commercial bookings growth, 75% constant currency, that's 2x higher than we've seen in the last decade. I appreciate there's some volatility with this metric, but it does feel like this quarter, there was a bit of a sea change relative to momentum on backlog and bookings. Can you just talk about maybe the breadth of where that strength came from? Was it broad-based? Was there a couple of large deals? Any color there would be helpful."
