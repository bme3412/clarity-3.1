          "content": "Q2 was a standout quarter: Search delivered double-digit revenue growth, AI Overviews serve over 2 billion users, AI Mode exceeds 100 million MAUs, and the Gemini app now has 450 million monthly users with daily requests up 50% from Q1. These experiences run on our Ironwood TPUs, NVIDIA B200/Blackwell GPUs, and a global network that processes nearly 1 trillion tokens per month."

We also launched an agent development kit with 1M downloads, agent space with 1M+ purchases, and we now process multimodal workflows for PayPal, Deutsche Bank, and BBVA."

AI is transforming Search (virtual trials, AI-powered calls, multimodal follow-ups) and YouTube (AI-powered Shorts effects, Creator ad tools). Firebase and Workspace utilize AI agents internally, just as we encourage customers to become agentic enterprises."

Shorts monetization now rivals long-form, and YouTube subscriptions (TV, Music, Premium) are scaling via new offers and Pixel/AI Pro bundles. Creator partnership hub and AI-powered ad creative tools are also boosting engagement."

Flex Credits and deterministic agent workflows accelerate pipelines, while partnerships with PayPal and enterprise users (Cap Gemini, LVMH, Salesforce) showcase the AI agent ecosystem."

With cloud demand accelerating, we now expect ~$85B of CapEx for 2025, up from $75B, funded by $95B in cash plus a $12.5B note issuance. We continue to return capital through $13.6B in buybacks and $2.5B in dividends."

We forecast continued elevated investments in infrastructure, safety, and product innovation while smoothing expenses across the back half of the year."
