          "content": "Gemini 2.5 Pro is the latest frontier model, but the real momentum is how it powers Search, Cloud, Assistant, Android, and the Gemini app. AI Overviews now serves 1.5 billion monthly users, AI Mode doubles query depth, and Circle to Search runs on more than 250 million devices—delivering multimodal experiences while we keep the foundation of quality and trust."

Lens visual searches grew by 5 billion queries since October, and Gemini Live camera and screen sharing are rolling out across Android devices. The investment in infrastructure enables both internal AI agents and customer-facing innovation."

Our agent developer kit, Google Agent Space, and Duet AI copilots bring agentic workflows to enterprises, while products like NotebookLM show what smaller teams can ship."
