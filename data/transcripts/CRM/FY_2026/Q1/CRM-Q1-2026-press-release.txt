Guidance
Yesterday, Salesforce announced that the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire Informatica Inc. There
is no anticipated impact to Salesforce’s FY26 guidance as a result of this transaction based on the expected close
timing in early FY27.
With the U.S. dollar weakening in Q1, Salesforce now expects a currency tailwind for the business. This tailwind has
been incorporated into the Company's updated FY26 guidance.
• Initiates second quarter FY26 revenue guidance of $10.11 billion to $10.16 billion, up 8% - 9% Y/Y and 7%
- 8% in CC
• Raises full year FY26 revenue guidance to $41.0 billion to $41.3 billion, up 8% - 9% Y/Y and 8% in CC
• Maintains full year FY26 GAAP operating margin guidance of 21.6%, and non-GAAP operating margin
guidance of 34.0%
• Maintains full year FY26 operating cash flow growth guidance of approximately 10% to 11% Y/Y
Salesforce's guidance includes GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. The following tables summarize
Salesforce's guidance for the second quarter fiscal 2026 and full-year fiscal 2026:
Q2 FY26 Guidance
GAAP Non-GAAP(1)
Revenue $10.11 - $10.16 billion
Revenue growth(2) 8% - 9% 7% - 8% CC, $100M Y/Y FX
Diluted net income per share $1.80 - $1.82 $2.76 - $2.78
Current remaining performance obligation growth(3) Approximately 10% Approximately 9% CC, $300M
Y/Y FX
Full Year FY26 Guidance
GAAP Non-GAAP(1)
Revenue $41.0 - $41.3 billion
Revenue growth(2) 8% - 9% Approximately 8% CC, $250M
Y/Y FX
Subscription & support revenue growth(4) Approximately 9.5% Approximately 9% CC
Operating margin 21.6% 34.0%
Diluted net income per share $7.15 - $7.21 $11.27 - $11.33
Operating cash flow growth Approximately 10% - 11%
Free cash flow growth Approximately 9% - 10%
(1) Non-GAAP CC revenue growth, non-GAAP CC remaining performance obligation growth, non-GAAP CC subscription &
support revenue growth, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP diluted net income per share, and free cash flow growth are
non-GAAP financial measures. See below for an explanation of non-GAAP financial measures. The Company's shares used in
computing GAAP diluted net income per share guidance and non-GAAP diluted net income per share guidance excludes any
impact to share count from potential Q2 - Q4 FY26 repurchase activity under our share repurchase program.
(2) Revenue FX impact is calculated by taking the current period rates compared to the prior period average rates.
(3) Current remaining performance obligation FX impact is calculated by taking the current period rates compared to the prior
period ending rates.
(4) Subscription & support revenue excludes professional services revenue.
The following is a reconciliation of GAAP operating margin guidance to non-GAAP operating margin guidance for
the full year:
Full Year FY26
Guidance
GAAP operating margin(1) 21.6%
Plus
Amortization of purchased intangibles(2) 3.7%
Stock-based compensation expense(2)(3) 8.4%
Restructuring(2)(3) 0.3%
Non-GAAP operating margin(1) 34.0%
(1) GAAP operating margin is the proportion of GAAP income from operations as a percentage of GAAP revenue. Non-GAAP
operating margin is the proportion of non-GAAP income from operations as a percentage of GAAP revenue.
(2) The percentages shown above have been calculated based on the midpoint of the low and high ends of the revenue guidance
for full year FY26.
(3) The percentages shown in the restructuring line have been calculated based on charges associated with the Company's
restructuring initiatives. Stock-based compensation expense excludes stock-based compensation expense related to the
Company's restructuring initiatives, which is included in the restructuring line.
The following is a per share reconciliation of GAAP diluted net income per share to non-GAAP diluted net income
per share guidance for the next quarter and the full year:
Fiscal 2026
Q2 FY26
GAAP diluted net income per share range(1)(2) $1.80 - $1.82 $7.15 - $7.21
Plus
Amortization of purchased intangibles $ 0.39 $ 1.57
Stock-based compensation expense $ 0.82 $ 3.54
Restructuring(3) $ — $ 0.11
Less
Income tax effects and adjustments(4) $ (0.25) $ (1.10)
Non-GAAP diluted net income per share(2) $2.76 - $2.78 $11.27 - $11.33
Shares used in computing basic net income per share (millions)(5) 960 963
Shares used in computing diluted net income per share (millions)(5) 967 971
(1) The Company's GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately 22.5% for the three months ended July 31, 2025 and the
year ended January 31, 2026. The GAAP tax rates may fluctuate due to discrete tax items and related effects in conjunction with
certain provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, future acquisitions or other transactions.
(2) The Company's projected GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per share assumes no change to the value of our strategic
investment portfolio as it is not possible to forecast future gains and losses. The impact of future gains or losses from the
Company’s strategic investment portfolio could be material.
(3) The estimated impact to GAAP diluted net income per share is in connection with the Company's restructuring initiatives.
(4) The Company’s non-GAAP tax provision uses a long-term projected tax rate of 22.0%, which reflects currently available
information and could be subject to change.
(5) The Company's shares used in computing GAAP net income per share guidance and non-GAAP net income per share
guidance excludes any impact to share count from potential Q2 - Q4 FY26 repurchase activity under our share repurchase
program.
For additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures see the reconciliation of results and related
explanations below.
Management will provide further commentary around these guidance assumptions on its earnings call.

Additional Metrics
(Unaudited)
Supplemental Revenue Analysis
Remaining Performance Obligation
Remaining performance obligation ("RPO") represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which
includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. RPO is influenced by
several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, the timing of term license deliveries, average contract terms and
foreign currency exchange rates. Remaining performance obligation is also impacted by acquisitions. Unbilled portions of RPO
denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. The portion of RPO that is
unbilled is not recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
RPO consisted of the following (in billions):
Current Noncurrent Total
As of April 30, 2025 $ 29.6 $ 31.3 $ 60.9
As of January 31, 2025 30.2 33.2 63.4
As of October 31, 2024 26.4 26.7 53.1
As of July 31, 2024 26.5 27.0 53.5
As of April 30, 2024 26.4 27.5 53.9
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue represents amounts that have been invoiced in advance of revenue recognition and is recognized as
revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred or services have been provided. The change in unearned revenue
was as follows (in millions):
Three Months Ended April 30,
2025 2024
Unearned revenue, beginning of period $ 20,743 $ 19,003
Billings and other (1) 6,885 6,191

Non-GAAP Financial Measures: This press release includes information about non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net
income per share, non-GAAP tax rates, free cash flow, constant currency revenue, constant currency subscription and support
revenue growth rate and constant currency current remaining performance obligation growth rates (collectively the “non-GAAP
financial measures”). These non-GAAP financial measures are measurements of financial performance that are not prepared in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and computational methods may differ from those used by other
companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP
measures and should be read only in conjunction with the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in
accordance with GAAP. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures when planning, monitoring and
evaluating the Company’s performance.
The primary purpose of using non-GAAP financial measures is to provide supplemental information that may prove useful to
investors and to enable investors to evaluate the Company’s results in the same way management does. Management believes
that supplementing GAAP disclosure with non-GAAP disclosure provides investors with a more complete view of the
Company’s operational performance and allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in the
Company’s business. Further to the extent that other companies use similar methods in calculating non-GAAP financial
measures, the provision of supplemental non-GAAP information can allow for a comparison of the Company’s relative
performance against other companies that also report non-GAAP operating results.
Non-GAAP operating margin is the proportion of non-GAAP income from operations as a percentage of GAAP revenue. NonGAAP income from operations excludes the impact of the following items: stock-based compensation expense, amortization of
acquisition-related intangibles and charges associated with the Company's restructuring activities. Non-GAAP net income per
share excludes, to the extent applicable, the impact of the following items: stock-based compensation expense, amortization of
purchased intangibles, charges related to the Company's restructuring activities and income tax adjustments. These items are
excluded because the decisions that give rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but instead for the
Company’s long-term benefit over multiple periods.
As described above, the Company excludes or adjusts for the following in its non-GAAP results and guidance:
• Stock-Based Compensation Expense: The Company’s compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based
compensation expense to attract and retain employees and executives. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests
with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational
performance for any particular period. Thus, stock-based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally
unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period.
• Amortization of Purchased Intangibles: The Company views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such
as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts, trade names,
customer lists and customer relationships, and, in some cases, acquired lease intangibles, as items arising from preacquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are continually evaluated
for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, which is not typically affected by
operations during any particular period. Although the Company excludes the amortization of purchased intangibles
from these non-GAAP financial measures, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that
such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation.
• Restructuring: Restructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and may include employee
notice period costs and severance payments, lease or contract termination costs, asset impairments, accelerated
depreciation and amortization and other related expenses. The Company excludes these restructuring charges because
they are distinct from ongoing operational costs and it does not believe they are reflective of current and expected
future business performance and operating results.
• Gains (Losses) on Strategic Investments, net: The Company records all fair value adjustments to its equity securities
held within the strategic investment portfolio through the statement of operations. As it is not possible to forecast
future gains and losses, the Company assumes no change to the value of its strategic investment portfolio in its GAAP
and non-GAAP estimates for future periods, including its guidance. Gains (Losses) on Strategic Investments, net, are
included in its GAAP financial statements.
• Income Tax Effects and Adjustments: The Company utilizes a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate in order to
provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of items such as changes in
the tax valuation allowance and tax effects of acquisition-related costs, since each of these can vary in size and 
frequency. When projecting this long-term rate, the Company evaluated a three-year financial projection that excludes
the direct impact of the following non-cash items: stock-based compensation expenses and the amortization of
purchased intangibles. The projected rate also considers factors including the Company’s expected tax structure, its tax
positions in various jurisdictions and key legislation in major jurisdictions where the Company operates. For fiscal
2025, the Company used a projected non-GAAP tax rate of 22.0%. For fiscal 2026, the Company uses a projected nonGAAP tax rate of 22.0%, which reflects currently available information, as well as other factors and assumptions. The
non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax
environment, significant changes in the Company’s geographic earnings mix due to acquisition activity or other
changes to the Company’s strategy or business operations. The Company will re-evaluate its long-term rate as
appropriate.
The Company presents constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how the Company's underlying
business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present constant currency revenue growth
rates, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are
converted into United States dollars at the weighted average exchange rate for the quarter being compared to rather than the
actual exchange rates in effect during that period. To present current remaining performance obligation growth rates on a
constant currency basis, current remaining performance obligation balances in local currencies in previous comparable periods
are converted using the United States dollar currency exchange rate as of the most recent balance sheet date.
The Company defines Data Cloud and AI annual recurring revenue ("ARR") as the annualized recurring value of active Data
Cloud and certain generative Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) subscription agreements, including those for Agentforce and
standalone generative AI products, at the end of the reporting period.
The Company defines the non-GAAP measure free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities, less capital
expenditures.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This presentation includes information about non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP expenses, non-GAAP operating margin, free cash
flow and constant currency revenue and constant currency current remaining performance obligation growth rates (collectively the “non-GAAP financial measures”). These nonGAAP financial measures are measurements of financial performance that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and computational
methods may differ from those used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP
measures and should be read only in conjunction with the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management uses both
GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures when planning, monitoring and evaluating the Company’s performance.
The primary purpose of using non-GAAP financial measures is to provide supplemental information that may prove useful to investors and to enable investors to evaluate the

the extent that other companies use similar methods in calculating non-GAAP financial measures, the provision of supplemental non-GAAP information can allow for a comparison

Constant currency information is provided as a framework for assessing how our underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To
present constant currency revenue, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States
dollars at the weighted average exchange rate for the quarter being compared to for growth rate calculations presented, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during that
period. To present current remaining performance obligation on a constant currency basis, we convert the current remaining performance obligation balances in local currencies in
previous comparable periods using the United States dollar currency exchange rate as of the most recent balance sheet date.
