          "content": "OCI demand is extraordinary; we now have 101 cloud regions and the growth in contracted power is outpacing the region count. We expect to double capacity this year and triple it by the end of FY26, keeping power constrained only by the pace of customer deployments."

The cloud gross profit dollars are up double digits, and we are still seeing accelerated bookings driven by AI contracts, which further expand our RPO."
