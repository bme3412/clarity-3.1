AUSTIN, Texas, March 10, 2025 -- Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) today announced fiscal
2025 Q3 results. Total Remaining Performance Obligations were up 62% year-over-year in USD, and
up 63% in constant currency, to $130 billion. Total quarterly revenues were up 6% year-over-year
in USD, and up 8% in constant currency, to $14.1 billion. Cloud services and license support
revenues were up 10% year-over-year in USD, and up 12% in constant currency, to $11.0 billion.
Cloud license and on-premise license revenues were down 10% in USD and down 8% in constant
currency, to $1.1 billion.
Q3 GAAP operating income was $4.4 billion. Non-GAAP operating income was $6.2 billion,
up 7% in USD, and up 9% in constant currency. GAAP operating margin was 31%, and non-GAAP
operating margin was 44%. GAAP net income was $2.9 billion, up 22% in USD, and up 27% in
constant currency. Non-GAAP net income was $4.2 billion, up 6% in USD, and up 9% in constant
currency. Q3 GAAP earnings per share was $1.02, up 20% in USD and up 25% in constant currency,
while non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.47, up 4% in USD, and up 7% in constant currency.
Short-term deferred revenues were $9.0 billion. Over the last twelve months, operating
cash flow was $20.7 billion and free cash flow was $5.8 billion.
“Oracle signed sales contracts for more than $48 billion in Q3,” said Oracle CEO, Safra Catz.
“This record sales number pushed our Remaining Performance Obligations, or RPO, up 63% to over
$130 billion. We have now signed cloud agreements with several world leading technology
companies including: OpenAI, xAI, Meta, NVIDIA and AMD. We expect that our huge $130 billion
sales backlog will help drive a 15% increase in Oracle’s overall revenue in our next fiscal year
beginning this June. And we expect RPO to continue to grow rapidly—as we look forward to signing
our first Stargate contract—yet another big opportunity for Oracle to expand both its AI training
and AI inferencing businesses in the near future.”
“We are on schedule to double our data center capacity this calendar year,” said Oracle
Chairman and CTO, Larry Ellison. “Customer demand is at record levels. Our Database MultiCloud
revenue from Microsoft, Google and Amazon is up 92% in the last three months alone. GPU
consumption for AI training grew 244% in the last 12 months. And we are seeing enormous
demand for AI inferencing on our customers’ private data. So, we are connecting OpenAI ChatGPT,
xAI Grok and Meta Llama directly to Version 23ai of the Oracle Database with advanced vector
capabilities. This new product, called the Oracle AI Data Platform, makes it easy for customers to
use any of the world’s leading AI models to analyze all of their private data—while keeping all their
data private and secure.”
Oracle also announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of
$0.50 per share of outstanding common stock, reflecting a 25% increase over the current quarterly
dividend of $0.40. Larry Ellison, Oracle’s Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Technology
Officer, and largest stockholder, did not participate in the deliberation or the vote on this matter.
This increased dividend will be paid to stockholders of record as of the close of business on April
10, 2025, with a payment date of April 23, 2025.

Income tax effects were calculated reflecting an effective GAAP tax rate of 14.9% and 16.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, and an effective non-GAAP tax rate of 19.9% and 18.9% in the third
quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. The difference in our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in each of the third quarters of fiscal 2025 and 2024 was primarily due to the net tax effects related to stock-based
compensation expense; acquisition related and other items, including the tax effects on amortization of intangible assets; and restructuring expense, partially offset by the net deferred tax effects related to an income tax
benefit that was previously recorded due to the partial realignment of our legal entity structure.
Estimated future annual amortization expense related to intangible assets as of February 28, 2025 was as follows:

Q4
To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flow generated from operations. We
believe free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation
or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.

APPENDIX A
ORACLE CORPORATION
Q3 FISCAL 2025 FINANCIAL RESULTS
EXPLANATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES
To supplement our financial results presented on a GAAP basis, we use the non-GAAP measures indicated in the tables, which exclude
certain business combination accounting entries and expenses related to acquisitions, as well as other significant expenses including
stock-based compensation, that we believe are helpful in understanding our past financial performance and our future results. Our nonGAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be
read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management regularly uses
our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating
decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods.
Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP
financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items, as well as the related income tax effects:
• Stock-based compensation expenses: We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expenses from our non-GAAP
operating expenses, income tax effects and net income measures. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our
employees, and we believe such compensation contributed to the revenues earned during the periods presented and also believe it will
contribute to the generation of future period revenues, we continue to evaluate our business performance excluding stock-based
compensation expenses. Stock-based compensation expenses will recur in future periods.
• Amortization of intangible assets: We have excluded the effect of amortization of intangible assets from our non-GAAP operating
expenses, income tax effects and net income measures. Amortization of intangible assets is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is
significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our
revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well. Amortization of intangible assets
will recur in future periods.
• Acquisition related and other expenses; and restructuring expenses: We have excluded the effect of acquisition related and other
expenses and the effect of restructuring expenses from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax effects and net income measures.
We incurred expenses in connection with our acquisitions and also incurred certain other operating expenses or income, which we
generally would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as a part of our continuing operations. Acquisition related and
other expenses consisted of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, certain business combination
adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended, and certain other operating items, net.
Restructuring expenses consisted of employee severance and other exit costs. We believe it is useful for investors to understand the
effects of these items on our total operating expenses. Although acquisition related and other expenses and restructuring expenses may
diminish over time with respect to past acquisitions and/or strategic initiatives, we generally will incur certain of these expenses in
connection with any future acquisitions and/or strategic initiatives.
