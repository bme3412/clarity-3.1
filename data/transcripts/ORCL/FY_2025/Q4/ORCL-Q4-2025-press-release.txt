“FY25 was a very good year—but we believe FY26 will be even better as our revenue
growth rates will be dramatically higher,” said Oracle CEO, Safra Catz. “We expect our total cloud
growth rate—applications plus infrastructure—will increase from 24% in FY25 to over 40% in FY26.
Cloud Infrastructure growth rate is expected to increase from 50% in FY25 to over 70% in FY26. And
RPO is likely to grow more than 100% in FY26. Oracle is well on its way to being not only the
world’s largest cloud application company—but also one of the world’s largest cloud infrastructure
companies.”
“MultiCloud database revenue from Amazon, Google and Azure grew 115% from Q3 to Q4,”
said Oracle Chairman and CTO, Larry Ellison. “We currently have 23 MultiCloud datacenters live
with 47 more being built over the next 12 months. We expect triple-digit MultiCloud revenue
growth to continue in FY26. Revenue from Oracle Cloud@Customer datacenters grew 104% yearover-year. We have 29 Oracle Cloud@Customer dedicated datacenters live with another 30 being
built in FY26. Overall Oracle Cloud Infrastructure consumption revenue grew 62% in Q4. We expect
OCI consumption revenue to grow even faster in FY26. OCI revenue growth rates are
skyrocketing—so is demand.”
The board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share of outstanding
common stock. This dividend will be paid to stockholders of record as of the close of business on
July 10, 2025, with a payment date of July 24, 2025.

Income tax effects were calculated reflecting an effective GAAP tax rate of 17.5% and 16.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, and an effective non-GAAP tax rate of 19.7% and 20.1% in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. The difference in our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in each of the fourth quarters of fiscal 2025 and 2024 was primarily due to the net tax effects related to stock-based
compensation expense; acquisition related and other items, including the tax effects on amortization of intangible assets; and restructuring expense, partially offset by the net deferred tax effects related to an income tax
benefit that was previously recorded due to the partial realignment of our legal entity structure.
Estimated future annual amortization expense related to intangible assets as of May 31, 2025 was as follows:

Q4
To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flow generated from operations. We
believe free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation
or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.

(2) We compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period using constant currency disclosure. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for
assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for
entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars at the exchange rates in effect on May 31, 2024 and 2023 for the fiscal 2025 and fiscal

APPENDIX A
ORACLE CORPORATION
Q4 FISCAL 2025 FINANCIAL RESULTS
EXPLANATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES
To supplement our financial results presented on a GAAP basis, we use the non-GAAP measures indicated in the tables, which exclude
certain business combination accounting entries and expenses related to acquisitions, as well as other significant expenses including
stock-based compensation, that we believe are helpful in understanding our past financial performance and our future results. Our nonGAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be
read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management regularly uses
our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating
decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods.
Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP
financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items, as well as the related income tax effects:
• Stock-based compensation expenses: We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expenses from our non-GAAP
operating expenses, income tax effects and net income measures. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our
employees, and we believe such compensation contributed to the revenues earned during the periods presented and also believe it will
contribute to the generation of future period revenues, we continue to evaluate our business performance excluding stock-based
compensation expenses. Stock-based compensation expenses will recur in future periods.
• Amortization of intangible assets: We have excluded the effect of amortization of intangible assets from our non-GAAP operating
expenses, income tax effects and net income measures. Amortization of intangible assets is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is
significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our
revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well. Amortization of intangible assets
will recur in future periods.
• Acquisition related and other expenses; and restructuring expenses: We have excluded the effect of acquisition related and other
expenses and the effect of restructuring expenses from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax effects and net income measures.
We incurred expenses in connection with our acquisitions and also incurred certain other operating expenses or income, which we
generally would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as a part of our continuing operations. Acquisition related and
other expenses consisted of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, certain business combination
adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended, and certain other operating items, net.
Restructuring expenses consisted of employee severance and other exit costs. We believe it is useful for investors to understand the
effects of these items on our total operating expenses. Although acquisition related and other expenses and restructuring expenses may
diminish over time with respect to past acquisitions and/or strategic initiatives, we generally will incur certain of these expenses in
connection with any future acquisitions and/or strategic initiatives.
