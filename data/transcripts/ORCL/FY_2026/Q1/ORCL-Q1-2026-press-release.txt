AUSTIN, Texas, September 9, 2025 -- Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) today announced
fiscal 2026 Q1 results. Total Remaining Performance Obligations were up 359% year-over-year in
both USD and constant currency to $455 billion. Total quarterly revenues were up 12% in USD, and
up 11% in constant currency to $14.9 billion. Cloud revenues were up 28% in USD, and up 27% in
constant currency to $7.2 billion. Software revenues were down 1% in USD, and down 2% in
constant currency to $5.7 billion.
Q1 GAAP operating income was $4.3 billion. Non-GAAP operating income was $6.2 billion,
up 9% year-over-year in USD and up 7% in constant currency. GAAP net income was $2.9 billion.
Non-GAAP net income was $4.3 billion, up 8% in USD and up 6% in constant currency. Q1 GAAP
earnings per share was $1.01, down 2% in USD and down 5% in constant currency. Non-GAAP
earnings per share was $1.47, up 6% in USD and up 4% in constant currency.
Short-term deferred revenues were $12.1 billion. Over the last twelve months, operating
cash flow was $21.5 billion, up 13% in USD.
“We signed four multi-billion-dollar contracts with three different customers in Q1,” said
Oracle CEO, Safra Catz. “This resulted in RPO contract backlog increasing 359% to $455 billion. It
was an astonishing quarter—and demand for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure continues to build. Over 
Confidential – Oracle Internal
the next few months, we expect to sign-up several additional multi-billion-dollar customers and
RPO is likely to exceed half-a-trillion dollars. The scale of our recent RPO growth enables us to make
a large upward revision to the Cloud Infrastructure portion of Oracle’s overall financial plan which
we will be presenting in detail next month at the Financial Analyst Meeting. As a bit of a preview,
we expect Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue to grow 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year—and then
increase to $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion, and $144 billion over the subsequent four years.
Most of the revenue in this 5-year forecast is already booked in our reported RPO. Oracle is off to a
brilliant start to FY26.”
“MultiCloud database revenue from Amazon, Google and Microsoft grew at the incredible
rate of 1,529% in Q1,” said Oracle Chairman and CTO, Larry Ellison. “We expect MultiCloud revenue
to grow substantially every quarter for several years as we deliver another 37 datacenters to our
three Hyperscaler partners, for a total of 71. And next month at Oracle AI World, we will introduce
a new Cloud Infrastructure service called the ‘Oracle AI Database’ that enables our customers to
use the Large Language Model of their choice—including Google’s Gemini, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, xAI’s
Grok, etc.—directly on top of the Oracle Database to easily access and analyze all their existing
database data. This revolutionary new cloud service enables the tens of thousands of our database
customers to instantly unlock the value in their data by making it easily accessible to the most
advanced AI reasoning models. Oracle AI Cloud Infrastructure and the Oracle MultiCloud AI
Database will both contribute to dramatically increasing cloud demand and consumption over the
next several years. AI Changes Everything.”
The board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share of outstanding
common stock. This dividend will be paid to stockholders of record as of the close of business on
October 9, 2025, with a payment date of October 23, 2025.

Non-GAAP
DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING
Three Months Ended
Stock-based compensation was included in the following GAAP operating expense categories:
August 31, 2025 August 31, 2024
Income tax effects were calculated reflecting an effective GAAP tax rate of 14.6% and 7.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and 2025, respectively, and an effective non-GAAP tax rate of 20.5% and 18.9% in the first quarter
of fiscal 2026 and 2025, respectively. The difference in our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 was primarily due to the net tax effects related to stock-based compensation expense; acquisition
related and other items, including the tax effects on amortization of intangible assets; and restructuring expense, partially offset by the impact of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (refer to Appendix A for additional
information), and net deferred tax effects related to an income tax benefit that was previously recorded due to the partial realignment of our legal entity structure. The difference in our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in the
first quarter of fiscal 2025 was primarily due to the net tax effects related to stock-based compensation expense; acquisition related and other items, including the tax effects on amortization of intangible assets; and
restructuring expense, partially offset by the net deferred tax effects related to an income tax benefit that was previously recorded due to the partial realignment of our legal entity structure.
Estimated future annual amortization expense related to intangible assets as of August 31, 2025 was as follows:

Q4
To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flow generated from operations.
We believe free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in
isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.

APPENDIX A
ORACLE CORPORATION
Q1 FISCAL 2026 FINANCIAL RESULTS
EXPLANATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES
To supplement our financial results presented on a GAAP basis, we use the non-GAAP measures indicated in the tables, which exclude
certain business combination accounting entries and expenses related to acquisitions, as well as other significant expenses including
stock-based compensation, that we believe are helpful in understanding our past financial performance and our future results. Our nonGAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be
read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management regularly uses
our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating
decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods.
Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP
financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items, as well as the related income tax effects related to each of the
below items except for the impact of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act:
• Stock-based compensation expenses: We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expenses from our non-GAAP
operating expenses, income tax effects and net income measures. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our
employees, and we believe such compensation contributed to the revenues earned during the periods presented and also believe it will
contribute to the generation of future period revenues, we continue to evaluate our business performance excluding stock-based
compensation expenses. Stock-based compensation expenses will recur in future periods.
• Amortization of intangible assets: We have excluded the effect of amortization of intangible assets from our non-GAAP operating
expenses, income tax effects and net income measures. Amortization of intangible assets is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is
significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our
revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well. Amortization of intangible assets
will recur in future periods.
• Acquisition related and other expenses; and restructuring expenses: We have excluded the effect of acquisition related and other
expenses and the effect of restructuring expenses from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax effects and net income measures.
We incurred expenses in connection with our acquisitions and also incurred certain other operating expenses or income, which we
generally would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as a part of our continuing operations. Acquisition related and
other expenses consisted of personnel-related costs for transitional and certain other employees, certain business combination
adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended, and certain other operating items, net.
Restructuring expenses consisted of employee severance and other exit costs. We believe it is useful for investors to understand the
effects of these items on our total operating expenses. Although acquisition related and other expenses and restructuring expenses may
diminish over time with respect to past acquisitions and/or strategic initiatives, we generally will incur certain of these expenses in
connection with any future acquisitions and/or strategic initiatives.
• Impact of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA): OBBBA was signed into law on July 4, 2025. We recorded a net tax expense of $958
million during the first quarter of fiscal 2026, primarily related to the remeasurement of a deferred tax liability previously recorded during
fiscal 2021, as part of the partial realignment of our legal entity structure. We have excluded the impact of this charge from our nonGAAP income taxes and net income measures in the first quarter of fiscal 2026. We believe making these adjustments provides insight
to our operating performance and comparability to past operating results.
