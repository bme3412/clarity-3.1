          "reasoning": "The answer contains mostly accurate information derived from the context, but there are some issues. The correct data points include: Q1 FY2026 total revenue of $77.7B (+18% YoY, +17% CC), operating income of $38B (+24% YoY); Q4 FY2025 revenue of $76.4B (+18% YoY), operating income of $34.3B (+23% YoY); Q3 FY2025 revenue of $70.1B (+13% YoY, +15% CC), operating income growth of +16% YoY; commercial bookings grew 112% (111% CC); RPO reached $392B (+51%) with ~35% recognized in next 12 months. However, there are inaccuracies: 1) The Q4 FY2025 Intelligent Cloud segment revenue is stated as $33,976M but the context shows it was $29,878M; 2) The Q2 FY2025 Intelligent Cloud revenue is stated as $25,535M but the context shows $25,544M (minor discrepancy); 3) The claim that 'Intelligent Cloud segment consistently represents the largest revenue contributor' is not accurate - in Q4 FY2025, Productivity and Business Processes ($33,112M) was larger than Intelligent Cloud ($29,878M). The answer also makes interpretive statements about cloud being the 'primary growth driver' which is supported by the context's notes about 'Cloud and AI strength.'"

          "reasoning": "The generated answer is fully consistent with the ground truth and provides substantially more detail. The ground truth states that Microsoft Azure shows strong growth driven by AI services and enterprise cloud adoption, contributing significantly to overall revenue growth. The generated answer confirms this with specific data: Intelligent Cloud segment showing strong performance, total revenue growth of +18% YoY, commercial bookings grew 112% driven by Azure/OpenAI commitments, and explicitly states 'Cloud and AI are consistently cited as the primary growth drivers.' The answer provides concrete numbers and metrics that support and expand upon the ground truth's claims without contradicting any facts."
