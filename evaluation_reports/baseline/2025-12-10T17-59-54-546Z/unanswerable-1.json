  "question": "What was Tesla's automotive revenue in Q2 2019?",
  "ground_truth": "Not found in provided sources.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n- No Tesla automotive revenue data for Q2 2019 found in provided sources\n- Context contains NVIDIA financial data for 2026 Q3, not Tesla Q2 2019 data [C1][C2]\n- Automotive revenue mentioned is for NVIDIA's Automotive and Robotics segment: $0.592B (+32% YoY) for 2026 Q3 [C2]\n Final Answer:\nNot found in provided sources.\nThe provided context contains NVIDIA financial data for 2026 Q3, including their Automotive and Robotics segment revenue of $0.592B (+32% YoY) [C2], but does not include Tesla's automotive revenue for Q2 2019.",
  "duration_ms": 5736,
  "metrics": {
    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.7,
      "reasoning": "The answer is relevant in that it directly addresses the question by acknowledging that Tesla's Q2 2019 automotive revenue data was not found in the provided sources. It correctly identifies that the available data pertains to NVIDIA, not Tesla, and explains this discrepancy. While it doesn't provide the requested information, it appropriately indicates the limitation of the available data rather than providing incorrect or unrelated information. The response is honest and transparent about what it cannot answer."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer is completely faithful to the provided context. The response correctly identifies that: 1) The context does not contain Tesla automotive revenue data for Q2 2019, 2) The context contains NVIDIA financial data (not Tesla), 3) The automotive revenue mentioned ($0.592B with +32% YoY) is accurately cited from Chunk 2 and correctly attributed to NVIDIA's Automotive and Robotics segment. The answer appropriately states 'Not found in provided sources' rather than hallucinating information about Tesla that isn't present in the context."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that Tesla automotive revenue for Q2 2019 is not found in the provided sources, which matches the ground truth. The generated answer provides additional helpful context explaining what data IS available (NVIDIA data for 2026 Q3), but this extra detail is consistent with and does not contradict the core finding that the requested Tesla Q2 2019 data is not available."
