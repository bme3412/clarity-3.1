    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.3,
      "reasoning": "The answer acknowledges the question about Oracle's Q4 2016 capital expenditures but fails to provide the requested information. It correctly states that the data was not found in the provided sources, which is honest and transparent. However, the answer doesn't actually address the question with relevant data. The response is partially relevant because it attempts to answer the question and explains why it cannot provide the information, but it ultimately doesn't deliver the requested capital expenditure figures."

    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer is completely faithful to the provided context. The context only contains information about Oracle's Q1 FY2026 financial data, including total revenue of $14.9 billion. The answer correctly states that no capital expenditure data for Q4 2016 was found in the provided sources, and accurately notes that the available context only covers Q1 2026 financial information. The answer does not hallucinate or fabricate any information - it appropriately acknowledges the limitations of the provided context rather than making up data that isn't present."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the information was not found in the provided sources, which matches the ground truth. While the generated answer provides additional context about what was available (Q1 2026 data) and explains why the Q4 2016 data wasn't found, this extra detail is consistent with and supports the core finding that the requested information was not available. The key fact - that the answer was not found - is accurately conveyed."
