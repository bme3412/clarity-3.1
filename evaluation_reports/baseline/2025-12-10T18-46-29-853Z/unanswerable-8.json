  "question": "What was Microsoft’s Copilot revenue in Q1 2022?",
  "ground_truth": "Not found in provided sources.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n• Microsoft's Q1 2022 total revenue was $45.3B [C1]\n• No specific mention of \"Copilot\" product or revenue found in the provided sources\n• Microsoft Cloud offerings mentioned include Azure, Dynamics 365, Microsoft 365, Power Platform, GitHub, and VS Code [C6]\n• Large enterprise commitments were driven by comprehensive Microsoft Cloud scope [C7]\n Final Answer:\nNot found in provided sources.\nMicrosoft's specific Copilot revenue for Q1 2022 is not available in the provided context. The sources show Microsoft's total revenue of $45.3B for Q1 2022 [C1] and discuss various Microsoft Cloud offerings including Azure, Microsoft 365, and Dynamics 365 [C6], but contain no references to Copilot as a distinct product or revenue stream during this period.",

  "metrics": {
    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is highly relevant to the question. It directly addresses the user's query about Microsoft's Copilot revenue in Q1 2022 by honestly stating that this specific information was not found in the provided sources. The answer provides helpful context by mentioning the total revenue figure and other cloud offerings that were documented, while clearly explaining that Copilot was not mentioned as a distinct product or revenue stream. This is an appropriate and informative response when the requested data is not available."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer is completely faithful to the provided context. The response correctly states that Copilot revenue information is not found in the sources, which is accurate - none of the 9 chunks mention 'Copilot' as a product or revenue stream. The answer appropriately cites the total revenue figure of $45.3B from Chunk 1 (which shows revenue: 45317, meaning $45.317B), and correctly references Microsoft Cloud offerings from Chunk 6. The answer does not hallucinate or add information not present in the context, and properly acknowledges the limitation of the available data."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the specific information requested (Copilot revenue) is not found in the provided sources, which matches the ground truth of 'Not found in provided sources.' The generated answer provides additional context about what information IS available in the sources (total revenue, cloud offerings), but this extra detail is consistent and does not contradict the ground truth. The core conclusion is the same: the requested information is not available."
