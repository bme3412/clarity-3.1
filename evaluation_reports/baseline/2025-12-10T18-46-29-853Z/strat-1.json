  "question": "What are AMD's strategic priorities for AI as of late 2024?",
  "ground_truth": "AMD is focusing on expanding its Instinct data center GPU portfolio (specifically MI300), enhancing the ROCm software stack to compete with CUDA, and driving adoption across cloud and enterprise markets.",

      "score": 0.1,
      "reasoning": "The answer does not address the question about AMD's strategic priorities for AI. It simply states that the information was not found in the provided sources, which is a non-answer. While this may be an honest response given limited source material, it provides no useful information to the user about AMD's AI strategy. A small score above 0 is given because the response at least acknowledges the question rather than providing completely unrelated information."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer 'Not found in provided sources' is faithful to the context because the provided chunks contain only forward-looking statements and risk factors related to AMD's business operations. There is no specific question being answered here, and the context does not contain information that would directly answer a typical factual question. The chunks discuss various risk factors like government regulations, competition, supply chain issues, and market conditions, but without knowing the original question, the answer appropriately indicates that the specific information sought was not present in these risk disclosure passages."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer states 'Not found in provided sources' which provides no factual information about AMD's AI strategy. The ground truth contains specific details about AMD's focus on Instinct data center GPU portfolio (MI300), ROCm software stack improvements, and market expansion efforts. The generated answer completely fails to address any of these key points and provides no useful information."
