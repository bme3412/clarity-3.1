  "ground_truth": "Not found in provided sources.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n- Reality Labs operating loss for Q1 2017: Not found in provided sources [C1, C2]\n- Available Reality Labs data: Q3 2025 revenue of $0.47B (+74% YoY) [C2]\n- Historical Q1 2017 Reality Labs operating loss data: Not found in provided sources [C1, C2]\n Final Answer:\nNot found in provided sources.\nThe provided context contains Reality Labs financial data for Q3 2025, showing revenue of $0.47B (+74% YoY) [C2], but does not include any operating loss information for Q1 2017 or any historical data from that time period.",

    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.8,
      "reasoning": "The answer is relevant to the question as it directly addresses the user's query about Meta's Reality Labs operating loss in Q1 2017. The response appropriately acknowledges that the specific information requested is not available in the provided sources, and explains what data is available instead. This is a valid and helpful response when the requested information cannot be found, rather than providing incorrect or fabricated data."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer is completely faithful to the provided context. The system correctly identifies that the context only contains Reality Labs data for Q3 2025 (revenue of $0.47B with +74% YoY change) and does not contain any information about Q1 2017 operating losses. The answer appropriately states 'Not found in provided sources' rather than hallucinating information that isn't present in the context. This demonstrates perfect faithfulness by acknowledging the limitations of the available information."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the information about Reality Labs operating loss for Q1 2017 is not found in the provided sources, which matches the ground truth. The answer provides additional context about what data is available (Q3 2025 data), but this extra detail is consistent with and does not contradict the ground truth answer."
