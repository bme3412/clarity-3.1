  "question": "How many MI325X units did AMD ship in 2022?",
  "ground_truth": "Not found in provided sources.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n• MI325X GPUs are available now on DigitalOcean's AMD-based cloud offerings [C1]\n• MI325X is mentioned as part of AMD's Instinct GPU product line [C1]\n• No specific unit shipment numbers for MI325X are provided in the context [C1-C5]\n Final Answer:\nNot found in provided sources.\nThe provided context mentions that AMD Instinct MI325X GPUs are available now through DigitalOcean's cloud platform [C1], but does not contain any specific unit shipment data for the MI325X accelerator.",
  "duration_ms": 6969,
  "metrics": {
    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.8,
      "reasoning": "The answer is relevant to the question as it directly addresses the query about MI325X shipment numbers. It correctly acknowledges that the specific shipment data requested is not available in the provided sources, which is an appropriate and honest response. The answer also provides related context about MI325X availability. However, it's worth noting that MI325X likely wasn't available in 2022 (it's a newer product), so the answer could have been slightly more helpful by noting this temporal impossibility, but it still appropriately indicates the information wasn't found."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer is completely faithful to the provided context. The response correctly identifies that MI325X GPUs are mentioned as available through DigitalOcean (from Chunk 1: 'AMD Instinct MI325X GPUs available now'), and accurately states that no specific unit shipment numbers are provided in any of the chunks. The answer appropriately concludes with 'Not found in provided sources' since the context does not contain shipment data for MI325X. The atomic facts cited are all verifiable from the context, and the answer does not introduce any hallucinated information."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly concludes with 'Not found in provided sources,' which matches the ground truth. While the generated answer provides additional context about what information IS available (MI325X availability on DigitalOcean), it correctly identifies that no specific unit shipment numbers are provided. The core factual determination is consistent with the ground truth."
