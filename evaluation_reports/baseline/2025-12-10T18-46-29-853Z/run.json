The 17.6% YoY growth rate is explicitly stated in Chunk 1 as 'revenue_growth: 17.6'. The statement that Data Center accounts for more than 50% of revenue mix is directly quoted from Chunk 4. The answer correctly notes that QoQ growth rate was not found in the sources, which is accurate - no quarter-over-quarter comparison is provided in the context. The only minor issue is the characterization of 'strong Q3 2024 performance' which, while supported by the gross margin discussion in Chunk 4 ('we are very pleased with our Q3 gross margin performance'), is a slight interpretation rather than a direct quote. Overall, the answer contains no hallucinations and properly cites its sources."

The generated answer also provides additional accurate context about Data Center business contribution. The slight difference in the percentage representation (17.6% vs 18%) warrants a small deduction, but the core facts are essentially correct."

The ~$1.7 billion compute business comparison is supported by Chunk 7 (also from analyst questioning). However, there's a minor issue: the context shows these figures ($1.5B, $1.7B) were analyst estimates/questions rather than confirmed AMD statements, yet the answer presents them more definitively.

Not found in provided sources.' The generated answer focuses on GPU-specific revenue (~$1.5 billion) and guidance updates rather than the total segment revenue.

The Q4 2024 figure of $18.4B comes from Chunk 8, which states 'Fourth-quarter revenue was a record $18.4 billion' for data center. The Q3 2024 figure of $14.5B from Chunk 5 is correctly cited. However, the answer makes assumptions about fiscal year labeling (calling periods 'Q4 2025', 'Q3 2025', etc.) that aren't explicitly stated in the context. The total revenue figure of $39.3B matching Chunk 2's $39,331 million is accurate.

The context shows Q4 FY2026 guidance of '$65.0 ±2% billion USD' in C7, and Q4 FY2024 guidance of '$20B (+/-2%)' in C11. The answer incorrectly cites C11 for the $37.5B figure which doesn't exist there. The mid-70s gross margin claim is partially supported but attributed to wrong sources. The Blackwell demand and GB300 production facts from C4 and C6 are accurate. The $0.5T visibility claim is supported by C4. However, the core revenue guidance figure is fabricated, which is a critical error for a financial question."

The generated answer supports this with specific figures: Q4 2025 revenue guidance of $37.5B, Blackwell demand described as 'off the charts,' visibility to $0.5T in Blackwell/Rubin revenue, and extraordinary demand for GB200 NVLink72. All these details align with the 'optimistic guidance' and 'AI infrastructure demand' themes in the ground truth. The only minor gap is that the generated answer doesn't explicitly mention 'data center revenue' growth, though the AI infrastructure context implies this.

The citation of total revenue of $180.2B from C1 is correct (shown as 180169 in the data). The mention of 2024 CapEx guidance for AWS from C5 is also accurate.

The answer appropriately acknowledges the limitations of the available data and doesn't hallucinate any AWS revenue guidance figures. The slight deduction is for the unverifiable claim about the specific time period of the data."
