  "question": "How is the cloud computing market affecting Microsoft's business?",
  "ground_truth": "Microsoft Azure continues to show strong growth driven by AI services and enterprise cloud adoption, contributing significantly to overall revenue growth.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts Extracted\n- Azure and other cloud services revenue increased 40% (up 39% in constant currency) in Q1 2026 [C1]\n- Azure and other cloud services revenue increased 39% in Q4 2025 [C2]\n- Intelligent Cloud segment revenue was $30.9B in Q1 2026, up 28% (27% constant currency) [C1]\n- Intelligent Cloud segment revenue was $29.9B in Q4 2025, up 26% (25% constant currency) [C2]\n- Intelligent Cloud segment revenue was $26.8B in Q3 2025, up 21% (22% constant currency) [C3]\n- Intelligent Cloud segment revenue was $25.5B in Q2 2025, up 19% [C4]\n- Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 51% to $392B in Q1 2026 [C1]\n- Microsoft architected Azure for distributed computing fabric emphasizing hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructures [C5]\n- Azure hybrid benefits support lift-and-shift and modern cloud-native applications, aligning with customer needs for operational sovereignty and compliance [C6]\n---\n Final Answer\nAzure continues to drive Microsoft's cloud dominance with accelerating growth. In Q1 2026, Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 40% (39% constant currency) [C1], up from 39% in Q4 2025 [C2] and 31% in Q2 2025 [C4]. The Intelligent Cloud segment reached $30.9B in Q1 2026, up 28% [C1], following $29.9B (+26%) in Q4 2025 [C2], $26.8B (+21%) in Q3 2025 [C3], and $25.5B (+19%) in Q2 2025 [C4].\nCommercial remaining performance obligation surged 51% to $392B [C1], signaling strong forward demand visibility. Microsoft's architectural strategy positions Azure as a distributed computing fabric supporting hybrid and multi-cloud deployments [C5], with hybrid benefits enabling both lift-and-shift migrations and cloud-native applications while addressing sovereignty and compliance requirements [C6].\nMarket share data and competitive positioning versus AWS/GCP: Not found in provided sources.

      "reasoning": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the question about how cloud computing is affecting Microsoft's business. It provides detailed revenue figures for Azure and the Intelligent Cloud segment across multiple quarters, showing strong growth trends (40% Azure growth, 28% segment growth). It also discusses Microsoft's strategic positioning with hybrid/multi-cloud architecture. The answer is comprehensive with specific data points and citations. The only minor deduction is that it acknowledges missing information about market share vs competitors and AI workload specifics, but this doesn't detract significantly from the overall relevance."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the provided context, correctly citing Azure growth figures (40% in Q1 2026, 39% in Q4 2025, 33% in Q3 2025, 31% in Q2 2025) and Intelligent Cloud segment revenues. However, there are minor discrepancies: (1) The answer states Azure grew 31% in Q2 2025, which matches Chunk 1, but attributes Q4 2025 Azure growth as 39% when Chunk 3 shows it was 39% - this is correct. (2) The answer correctly notes the $392B commercial remaining performance obligation from Chunk 4. (3) The hybrid/multi-cloud architecture claims from Chunks 5 and 6 are accurately represented. (4) The answer appropriately acknowledges what information is not found in sources. The slight deduction is because the answer uses citation markers [C1]-[C6] that don't perfectly align with the chunk numbering provided, which could cause minor confusion, though the underlying facts are accurate."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.7,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer strongly supports the 'strong growth' aspect of the ground truth with detailed revenue figures showing Azure's 40% growth and Intelligent Cloud segment reaching $30.9B. It also demonstrates 'enterprise cloud adoption' through the commercial remaining performance obligation increase of 51% to $392B. However, the generated answer explicitly states that 'Specific AI workload contribution to Azure growth: Not found in provided sources,' which means it does not confirm the ground truth's claim that growth is 'driven by AI services.' The answer provides extensive quantitative detail about cloud growth but fails to validate the AI services component that is a key part of the ground truth statement."
