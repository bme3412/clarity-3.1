However, there are minor issues: (1) The QoQ change of +17% appears in C12 but the actual financial data in C1 shows revenue growth of 17.6% which may be YoY not QoQ - this creates slight ambiguity. (2) The $3.4B Data Center segment revenue is a reasonable inference from >50% of $6.8B but is not explicitly stated. (3) The $500M guidance increase is correctly sourced from C13.

The answer primarily provides historical revenue data (past quarters like Q1-Q3 FY2026, Q4 FY2025) rather than forward guidance. The answer explicitly acknowledges 'Explicit numerical forward guidance (e.g., Q4 FY2026 revenue target): Not found in provided sources.' While it mentions some strategic outlook items like visibility to $500B in Blackwell/Rubin revenue, this is not specific quarterly guidance. The answer is partially relevant as it provides context around revenue trends but fails to directly answer the question about upcoming quarter guidance."

Key accurate claims include: FY2026 Q3 revenue of $57.006B with YoY +62% and QoQ +22% (verified in Chunks 12, 18), FY2026 Q2 revenue of $46.743B with YoY +56% (Chunk 9, 15), FY2025 Q4 revenue of $39.331B with YoY +78% (Chunks 1, 8, 16), networking revenue of $8.2B with 162% YoY growth (Chunk 4), $7.3B networking in Q2 (Chunk 6), GB300 at 1,000 racks/week (Chunk 6), visibility to $500B Blackwell/Rubin revenue (Chunk 4), and Rubin on schedule (Chunks 5, 6). However, there are minor issues: FY2026 Q1 revenue is stated as $44.062B with YoY +69%, but Chunk 10 shows YoY change was actually +69% (calculated from $26.044B prior year), which is correct. The claim that 'Blackwell Ultra generating tens of billions' is supported by Chunk 6. The nine-month revenue figure of $147.811B is verified in Chunk 12. Some citation references (like C8, C10, C11, C13, C14, C15) don't perfectly align with the chunk numbering provided, suggesting minor citation errors, but the underlying facts are present in the context. No major hallucinations detected."

However, it provides substantial supporting evidence that aligns with the spirit of the ground truth: CEO visibility to $500B in Blackwell/Rubin revenue, AI infrastructure spend scaling to hundreds of billions, strong revenue growth trajectory (62% YoY), and product roadmap execution (GB300 ramping, Rubin on schedule). The answer notes that explicit numerical forward guidance was 'not found' but the strategic outlook information supports the notion of optimistic expectations. The answer is more detailed but doesn't directly confirm the 'optimistic guidance' framing or specifically mention 'data center revenue' growth expectations."

The operating environment challenges mentioned (supply constraints, weak PC market) are supported by Chunks 6 and 8. Minor deduction because the answer references chunk numbers [C1-C11] that don't perfectly align with the actual chunk numbering provided, and some specific claims about 'Data Center GPU breakouts' go slightly beyond what's explicitly stated, though the conclusion that such data is absent is correct."
