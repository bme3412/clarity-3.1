  "question": "Did Broadcom report FY2016 networking segment revenue?",
  "ground_truth": "Not found in provided sources.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts Extracted:\n- Not found in provided sources. [C1, C2 contain only FY2025 Q3 data, with no FY2016 segment revenue information]\n---\nFinal Answer:\nNot found in provided sources. The provided context contains only Q3 FY2025 financial data, including total revenue of $15,952M and segment breakdowns for that quarter [C1][C2]. No FY2016 networking segment revenue or total segment revenue figures are available in the materials provided.",

  "metrics": {
    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.8,
      "reasoning": "The answer is relevant to the question as it directly addresses whether FY2016 networking segment revenue was reported. The answer correctly states that the information was not found in the provided sources and explains why (only FY2025 data was available). While it doesn't provide the actual FY2016 data, it appropriately responds to the question by indicating the limitation of the available sources. The score is not 1.0 because the answer could have been more concise, but it is still a relevant and appropriate response to the question asked."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer is completely faithful to the provided context. The system correctly identified that the context only contains Q3 FY2025 financial data (showing revenue of $15,952M) and does not contain any FY2016 information. The answer appropriately states 'Not found in provided sources' rather than hallucinating or fabricating FY2016 data that isn't present in the context. The citations [C1][C2] correctly reference the chunks provided."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the information is not found in the provided sources, which matches the ground truth. The generated answer provides additional context explaining why the information isn't available (the sources only contain FY2025 Q3 data, not FY2016 data), which is consistent with and more detailed than the ground truth answer. The core factual claim - that the requested information is not available - is accurate."
