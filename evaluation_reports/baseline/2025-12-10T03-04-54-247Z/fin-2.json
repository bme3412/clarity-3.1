While the context contains extensive information about AMD's Q3 2024 earnings call, including discussions about Data Center GPU revenue, MI300/MI325 products, and various analyst questions, there is no specific question being asked that the system is trying to answer. The context chunks provide general earnings call information but without knowing what specific question was posed, stating 'Not found in provided sources' is an appropriate and faithful response that avoids hallucination. The system correctly avoided making up information that wasn't explicitly requested or clearly present in the context."

The ground truth contains specific details including the record $3.5 billion revenue figure, Q3 2024 timeframe, 122% year-over-year growth, and the drivers (AMD Instinct GPUs and EPYC CPUs). The generated answer completely fails to provide any of this information, making it factually incorrect by omission."
