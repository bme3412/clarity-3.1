    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.8,
      "reasoning": "The answer is relevant to the question as it directly addresses the query about Slack revenue in Q3 2018. While it doesn't provide the actual revenue figure, it appropriately explains that the information is not available in the provided sources and clarifies what data is actually present. This is a valid and helpful response when the requested information cannot be found, making it relevant even though it doesn't contain the specific data requested."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer is completely faithful to the provided context. The generated answer correctly identifies that the context does not contain Slack revenue data for Q3 2018, and accurately notes that the context only contains Q2 FY26 Salesforce data. The answer appropriately states 'Not found in provided sources' rather than hallucinating information that isn't present. This demonstrates perfect faithfulness by acknowledging the limitations of the available context."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the information was not found in the provided sources, which matches the ground truth. The generated answer provides additional detail explaining why the information wasn't found (context only contains Q2 FY26 Salesforce data, not Q3 2018 data), but this additional context is consistent with and supports the ground truth answer. The core factual conclusion is identical."
