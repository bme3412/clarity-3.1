  "ground_truth": "Not found in provided sources.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n- Reality Labs operating loss for Q1 2017: Not found in provided sources [C1, C2]\n- Available Reality Labs data: Q3 2025 revenue of $0.47B (+74% YoY) [C2]\n- Historical Q1 2017 Reality Labs operating loss data: Not found in provided sources [C1, C2]\n Final Answer:\nNot found in provided sources.\nThe provided context contains Reality Labs financial data for Q3 2025, showing revenue of $0.47B (+74% YoY) [C2], but does not include any operating loss figures or financial data for Q1 2017.",

  "metrics": {
    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is relevant and appropriately addresses the question by clearly stating that the requested information (Reality Labs operating loss for Q1 2017) was not found in the provided sources. It also helpfully explains what data was available (Q3 2025 data) to contextualize why the specific question couldn't be answered. This is a valid and honest response when the information is not available in the source material."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer is completely faithful to the provided context. The system correctly identifies that the context does not contain information about Reality Labs operating loss for Q1 2017. The context only contains Q3 2025 data showing Reality Labs revenue of $0.47B (+74% YoY), which the answer accurately cites. The answer appropriately states 'Not found in provided sources' rather than hallucinating information that isn't present in the context."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the Q1 2017 Reality Labs operating loss information is not found in the provided sources, which matches the ground truth. The answer provides additional context about what data IS available (Q3 2025 figures), but this extra detail is consistent with the ground truth and does not contradict it. The core factual claim - that the requested information is not available - is accurate."
