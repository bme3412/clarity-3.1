  "question": "How did the AMD Data Center segment perform in Q3 2024?",
  "ground_truth": "The Data Center segment revenue reached a record $3.5 billion in Q3 2024, up 122% year-over-year, driven by strong sales of AMD Instinct GPUs and EPYC CPUs.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n• AMD Data Center GPU revenue was very strong in Q3 2024, with the company completing important customer milestones and ramping above initial expectations [C6]\n• AMD raised full-year Data Center GPU guidance from exceeding $4.5 billion to exceeding $5 billion based on completion of customer milestones [C6]\n• Data Center GPU revenue in September was approximately $1.5 billion [C5]\n• Data Center GPU business was approaching the size of AMD's compute business, which was around $1.7 billion [C7]\n• AMD had a very strong quarter for the Data Center overall in Q3, especially for the Instinct product portfolio [C6]\n Final Answer:\nAMD's Data Center segment delivered exceptional performance in Q3 2024, driven primarily by strong GPU revenue growth.\nData Center GPU Revenue: Approximately $1.5 billion in September [C5], approaching the size of AMD's compute business at ~$1.7 billion [C7]. The segment completed important customer milestones and ramped above initial expectations [C6].\nFull-Year Guidance Raised: AMD increased Data Center GPU guidance from exceeding $4.5 billion to exceeding $5 billion, representing a $500 million upward revision based on customer milestone completions [C6].\nInstinct Portfolio Strength: The Instinct product portfolio was particularly strong, contributing to the overall Data Center segment outperformance [C6].\nQuarterly Performance: AMD characterized Q3 as \"very strong\" for Data Center overall, with GPU revenue being the primary growth driver [C6].\nSpecific revenue breakdown by Data Center sub-segments and year-over-year growth percentages: Not found in provided sources.",

      "score": 0.9,
      "reasoning": "The answer directly addresses the question about AMD's Data Center segment performance in Q3 2024. It provides specific details including GPU revenue (~$1.5 billion), raised full-year guidance (from $4.5B to $5B), strong Instinct portfolio performance, and overall characterization of the quarter as 'very strong.' The answer is well-structured with citations and acknowledges what information was not available. The only minor limitation is that it focuses heavily on the GPU portion of Data Center rather than the complete segment breakdown, but this appears to be due to source limitations which the answer transparently notes."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the provided context, with most claims properly supported by citations. The GPU revenue figures ($1.5B in September, approaching $1.7B compute business size), the guidance raise from $4.5B to $5B, and the strong Instinct portfolio performance are all accurately derived from the context. However, there are minor issues: (1) The answer states September revenue was 'approximately $1.5 billion' but the context [C5] phrases this as a question/estimate from an analyst ('It seems like it was in the $1.5 billion range'), not a confirmed figure. (2) The $500 million upward revision is correctly inferred from the guidance change but is presented with more certainty than the context supports. The answer appropriately notes what information was not found in sources, which is good practice."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.3,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer fails to provide the key specific facts from the ground truth: the total Data Center segment revenue of $3.5 billion and the 122% year-over-year growth. While the generated answer discusses Data Center GPU revenue (~$1.5 billion) and mentions strong performance, it explicitly states 'year-over-year growth percentages: Not found in provided sources' and does not mention the $3.5 billion total segment revenue figure. The generated answer focuses on GPU-specific metrics and guidance rather than the overall segment performance metrics stated in the ground truth. The information provided is not contradictory but is incomplete and misses the most important specific figures."
