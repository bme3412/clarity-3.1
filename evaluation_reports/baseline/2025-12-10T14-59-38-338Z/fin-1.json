  "question": "What was AMD's total revenue in Q3 2024?",
  "ground_truth": "AMD's total revenue in Q3 2024 was $6.8 billion, representing an 18% increase year-over-year.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n• Q3 2024 revenue: $6.819 billion [C1]\n• Revenue growth: +17.6% year-over-year [C1]\n• Quarter-over-quarter growth: +17% [C10]\n• Data Center business accounts for more than 50% of revenue mix [C4]\n• Gross margin: 53.6% in Q3 [C4]\n Final Answer:\nRevenue: $6.82B (YoY +18% / QoQ +17%) [C10]\nData Center business now represents more than 50% of AMD's revenue mix, driving the strong growth performance [C4]. The company delivered a gross margin of 53.6% in Q3 [C4].",

      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The answer directly addresses the question about AMD's total revenue in Q3 2024, providing the specific figure of $6.819 billion (rounded to $6.82B). It also provides additional relevant context including year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth percentages, gross margin, and revenue mix information. The answer is comprehensive and well-cited, though it includes some extra information beyond what was strictly asked."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the context, but contains some minor discrepancies. The atomic facts are well-cited: Q3 revenue of $6.819B is supported by C1, revenue growth of 17.6% YoY is in C1, QoQ growth of 17% is in C10, Data Center >50% of revenue mix is in C4, and gross margin of 53.6% is in C4. However, the final answer states 'YoY +18%' which comes from C10 but conflicts slightly with C1's 17.6% figure. This is a minor inconsistency between sources rather than a hallucination. The answer rounds $6.819B to $6.82B which is acceptable. All key claims are grounded in the provided context with no significant hallucinations."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer provides AMD's Q3 2024 revenue as $6.819 billion (rounded to $6.82B in the final answer), which is very close to the ground truth of $6.8 billion - this is essentially the same figure with more precision. The year-over-year growth is stated as both +17.6% and +18% in different parts of the answer, with the final answer showing +18% which matches the ground truth exactly. The minor discrepancy of 17.6% vs 18% is negligible as 17.6% rounds to 18%. The generated answer also provides additional accurate context about Data Center revenue mix and gross margin, which is consistent with providing more detail. The key facts align with the ground truth."
