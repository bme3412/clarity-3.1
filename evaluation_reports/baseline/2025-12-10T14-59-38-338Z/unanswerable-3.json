  "question": "Did Amazon provide 2026 AWS revenue guidance?",
  "ground_truth": "Not found in provided sources.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n- AWS growth momentum mentioned but no specific 2026 revenue guidance provided [C1]\n- AWS operating margins fluctuated from 39.5% in Q1 2025 to 32.9% in Q2 2025 [C2]\n- Total Amazon revenue was $187.8B in Q4 2024 (+10% YoY) and $158.9B in Q3 2024 (+11% YoY) [C3, C4]\n- No specific AWS revenue figures or 2026 guidance found in provided context\n Final Answer:\nAWS 2026 revenue guidance: Not found in provided sources.\nThe provided context contains AWS performance data through Q3 2025, including operating margin fluctuations from 39.5% to 32.9% [C2] and mentions of growth momentum [C1], but does not include specific AWS revenue figures or forward-looking guidance for 2026. Total Amazon revenue reached $187.8B in Q4 2024 (+10% YoY) [C3], but AWS segment revenue and 2026 projections are not detailed in the available sources.",

    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.9,
      "reasoning": "The answer directly addresses the question by clearly stating that no 2026 AWS revenue guidance was found in the provided sources. It appropriately explains what information was available (AWS performance data through Q3 2025, operating margins, growth momentum mentions) while confirming the absence of the specific 2026 guidance being asked about. The response is relevant and informative, though it includes some additional context that wasn't strictly necessary for answering the yes/no nature of the question."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.75,
      "reasoning": "The answer is mostly faithful to the context but contains some inaccuracies. The answer correctly states that no specific AWS 2026 revenue guidance is found. However, there are issues: (1) The answer claims AWS margins fluctuated from 39.5% in Q1 2025 to 32.9% in Q2 2025, but the context [Chunk 1] actually states these figures are from Q1 and Q2 without specifying 2025 - the chunk mentions Q3 2024 and Q4 2024 fiscal years in other chunks, so the year attribution may be incorrect. (2) The citation mapping is slightly off - the margin information is in Chunk 1, not Chunk 2 as cited. (3) The total revenue figures ($187.8B Q4 2024 and $158.9B Q3 2024) are correctly derived from Chunks 5 and 3 respectively. The core conclusion that AWS 2026 guidance is not available is accurate and faithful to the context."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly concludes that AWS 2026 revenue guidance was 'Not found in provided sources,' which matches the ground truth. While the generated answer provides additional context about AWS operating margins, total Amazon revenue, and other details from the sources, the core factual conclusion aligns with the ground truth. The extra detail is consistent and does not contradict the ground truth answer."
