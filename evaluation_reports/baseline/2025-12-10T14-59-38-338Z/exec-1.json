  "question": "What did AMD's CEO say about AI demand in recent earnings?",
  "ground_truth": "AMD CEO Lisa Su emphasized strong AI demand, particularly for MI300 accelerators, and outlined plans to expand AI product portfolio to capture growing market opportunity.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n• AMD's Q3 2025 revenue was $9.246B with 35.6% YoY growth [C1]\n• Q2 2025 revenue was $7.685B with 31.7% YoY growth [C2]  \n• Q1 2025 revenue was $7.438B with 35.9% YoY growth [C3]\n• In Q3 2025 earnings call, analyst asked about servers vs GPUs growth, with Jean Hu responding both grew nicely with servers slightly better directionally [C4]\n• Data Center guidance mentioned \"strong double digit\" sequential growth for Q4 [C4]\n• MI325 products started in Q4 2024 and ramped in first half of 2025 [C6]\n• MI350 Series includes multiple SKUs ranging from air-cooled to liquid-cooled configurations [C6]\n• MI300 showed great progress in customer data centers with workload qualification and production ramp [C8]\nNot found in provided sources: Specific CEO commentary on AI demand trends, detailed AI market outlook, or strategic AI positioning statements.\n Final Answer:\nAMD sustained strong AI-driven growth through 2025, with Q3 revenue reaching $9.246B (+35.6% YoY) [C1]. Both servers and GPUs contributed to data center momentum, with servers performing slightly better directionally according to management [C4]. The company guided to \"strong double digit\" sequential data center growth for Q4 [C4].\nAMD's AI product roadmap progressed with MI325 ramping in early 2025 after Q4 2024 launch, while the MI350 Series offers multiple SKUs from air-cooled to liquid-cooled configurations [C6]. Management highlighted successful MI300 customer adoption, noting strong progress in data center deployments, workload qualification, and production scaling [C8].\nThe consistent 30%+ revenue growth across recent quarters demonstrates sustained AI demand momentum, though specific CEO commentary on broader AI market trends was not found in provided sources.",

      "reasoning": "The answer provides substantial information about AMD's financial performance and AI product roadmap, but explicitly admits it did not find 'Specific CEO commentary on AI demand trends' which was the core of the question. The user specifically asked what AMD's CEO said about AI demand, but the answer mostly contains analyst Q&A responses (from Jean Hu, the CFO, not the CEO) and general financial metrics. While the information is related to AMD and AI, it doesn't directly answer what the CEO specifically said about AI demand. The answer is partially relevant but fails to address the specific request."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.35,
      "reasoning": "The answer contains significant hallucinations and misattributions. The context shows Q2 2024 and Q3 2024 data (chunks 4 and 6), but the answer claims these are Q1-Q3 2025 figures. The financial data in chunks 1-3 have no fiscal year/quarter labels, yet the answer assigns them to specific 2025 quarters. The answer attributes quotes to 'Jean Hu' citing [C4], but chunk 4 contains only JSON financial data with no analyst Q&A. The analyst Q&A content is actually in chunk 8, not chunk 4. The answer also cites [C6] for MI325 and MI350 information, but this content is actually in chunk 7. While some factual elements exist in the context (MI300 progress, MI350 SKU variations), the systematic misattribution of sources and incorrect temporal framing (2025 vs 2024) represents substantial unfaithfulness to the provided context."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.6,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer partially addresses the ground truth but with significant gaps. The ground truth specifically mentions CEO Lisa Su emphasizing strong AI demand for MI300 accelerators and plans to expand the AI product portfolio. The generated answer does mention MI300 progress in customer data centers and discusses the AI product roadmap (MI325, MI350), which aligns with 'expanding AI product portfolio.' However, the answer explicitly states 'specific CEO commentary on AI demand trends' was 'not found in provided sources,' which contradicts the ground truth's claim about Lisa Su's emphasis. The answer provides relevant financial data and product information that supports the AI demand narrative indirectly, but it fails to capture the specific CEO statements about strong AI demand that the ground truth highlights. The answer is factually consistent with what it claims but incomplete relative to the ground truth's specific focus on Lisa Su's commentary."
