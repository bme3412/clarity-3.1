  "question": "What are AMD's strategic priorities for AI as of late 2024?",
  "ground_truth": "AMD is focusing on expanding its Instinct data center GPU portfolio (specifically MI300), enhancing the ROCm software stack to compete with CUDA, and driving adoption across cloud and enterprise markets.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n• Not found in provided sources - specific AI strategy details for 2024\n• Not found in provided sources - strategic priorities for 2024\n• Investment in AI and software stack development mentioned as operating challenge [C2][C3]\n• Software investment described as \"big challenge\" for customer ramp [C2]\n• Customization demands from large cloud and enterprise customers noted as challenge [C2][C3]\n• MI300 gross margin expectations and accretion point referenced but details not provided [C1]\n Final Answer:\nAMD's specific AI strategy and strategic priorities for 2024 are not found in provided sources. The context only contains brief references indicating AMD is investing in AI and software stack development, with software investment characterized as a \"big challenge\" for achieving the next wave of customer ramp [C2]. The company faces customization demands from large cloud and enterprise customers [C2][C3], and there are mentions of MI300 gross margin considerations, though specific details about expectations or strategic direction are not provided [C1]. The available context lacks comprehensive information about AMD's 2024 AI strategic framework or priority initiatives.",

  "metrics": {
    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.6,
      "reasoning": "The answer is partially relevant as it attempts to address the question about AMD's AI strategic priorities. It honestly acknowledges that specific 2024 AI strategy details are not found in the sources, while still providing some relevant information about AI investments, software stack development, and MI300 considerations. However, the answer is limited in its ability to fully address the question due to source limitations, which reduces its relevance score. The response is transparent about what it can and cannot answer."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the provided context. It correctly identifies that specific AI strategy details are not found in the sources, and accurately cites the mentions of 'Investment in AI and software stack development' as an operating challenge, software investment being a 'big challenge' for customer ramp, and customization demands from cloud/enterprise customers. The MI300 reference is also present in the context. The answer appropriately acknowledges the limitations of the available information rather than fabricating details. A small deduction is made because the answer's atomic facts section mentions '[C1]' for MI300 but the MI300 reference actually appears in Chunk 3, not Chunk 1, showing a minor citation inconsistency."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.4,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer partially captures some relevant elements - it mentions MI300, software stack development, and cloud/enterprise customers, which align with the ground truth. However, the answer is framed as 'not found in provided sources' and presents the information as challenges rather than strategic focus areas. It fails to specifically mention the Instinct data center GPU portfolio expansion, ROCm software stack competing with CUDA, or clearly articulate that these are AMD's strategic priorities. The answer is vague and hedging where the ground truth is specific and definitive about AMD's AI strategy."
