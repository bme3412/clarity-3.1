Management expects 2026 CapEx and expenses to grow even faster, driven by infrastructure and talent investments [C1][C2].\nTo manage the multi-gigawatt data center expansion, Meta is exploring financing partnerships [C2]. Hiring remains concentrated on technical roles supporting AI, infrastructure, and monetization, with ~2,800 employees added in Q1 2025, the significant majority in these priority areas [C2][C4].\nInfrastructure investment is delivering strong ROI for ads and ranking systems, though GenAI monetization will lag [C2]. AI underpins five strategic pillars—ads, engagement, business messaging, Meta AI, and AI devices—with capital deployed downstream of general intelligence and infrastructure builds [C3]. Meta AI has reached nearly 1B monthly actives [C3], and infrastructure teams are scaling capacity to support current and future AI-driven products [C7].\nCapital allocation remains focused on reinvesting in infrastructure and talent as top priorities [C4].",

      "reasoning": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the question about Meta's AI infrastructure investments. It provides specific details including CapEx figures ($66-72B for FY 2025), year-over-year increases (~$30B), expense projections ($114-118B), hiring priorities focused on AI and infrastructure, data center expansion plans, and strategic areas where AI infrastructure is being deployed. The answer comprehensively covers financial commitments, operational execution, and strategic rationale for AI infrastructure investments. The only minor issue is that the format includes 'Atomic Facts Extracted' section which adds some noise, but the substantive content is directly responsive to the question."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer is highly faithful to the provided context. Almost all claims are directly traceable to the source chunks with accurate citations. Key facts verified: FY 2025 CapEx $66-72B and expenses $114-118B from C2/C4; 2026 growth expectations from C1/C2; data-center financing partnerships from C2; hiring focus and ~2,800 Q1 employees from C2/C4/C5; infrastructure ROI for ads/ranking and GenAI lag from C2; five AI pillars from C1; nearly 1B Meta AI MAUs from C1; infrastructure scaling from C7; capital allocation priorities from C5. The only minor issue is that the answer states 'C4' for some hiring details when chunk 5 (C5) contains the specific ~2,800 employee figure and capital allocation language. This is a citation labeling inconsistency rather than a factual hallucination. The substantive content is fully supported by the context."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer is consistent with and significantly more detailed than the ground truth. The ground truth states Meta is investing heavily in AI infrastructure including GPU clusters, custom AI chips, and data center expansion. The generated answer confirms this with specific details: $66-72B CapEx for FY 2025 (~$30B YoY increase), multi-gigawatt data center expansion with financing partnerships being explored, infrastructure teams scaling capacity, and 2026 CapEx expected to grow even faster. While the generated answer doesn't explicitly mention 'GPU clusters' or 'custom AI chips' by name, it covers the broader infrastructure investment theme comprehensively with concrete financial figures and strategic context. The answer provides substantially more detail about the scale, timeline, and purpose of these investments, all of which align with the ground truth's assertion of heavy AI infrastructure investment."
