      "score": 0.1,
      "reasoning": "The answer does not address the question about AMD's strategic priorities for AI. It simply states that the information was not found in the provided sources, which is a non-answer. While this may be an honest response given limited source material, it provides no useful information to the user about AMD's AI strategy. A small score above 0 is given because the response at least acknowledges the question rather than providing completely unrelated information."

    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer 'Not found in provided sources' is completely faithful to the context. The provided chunks contain metadata about AMD earnings calls including lists of operating environment challenges, but they do not contain specific substantive information that would answer a typical question. The chunks show partial transcript snippets that are questions from analysts rather than answers, and metadata fields. The generated answer appropriately acknowledges that the specific information being sought was not present in the provided context, which is an honest and faithful response rather than hallucinating information."

    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer states 'Not found in provided sources' which provides no factual information about AMD's AI strategy. The ground truth contains specific details about AMD's focus on Instinct data center GPU portfolio (MI300), ROCm software stack improvements, and market expansion efforts. The generated answer completely fails to address any of these key points and provides no useful information."
