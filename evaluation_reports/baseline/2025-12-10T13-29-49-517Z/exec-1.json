  "question": "What did AMD's CEO say about AI demand in recent earnings?",
  "ground_truth": "AMD CEO Lisa Su emphasized strong AI demand, particularly for MI300 accelerators, and outlined plans to expand AI product portfolio to capture growing market opportunity.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations\n- AMD Q3 2024 total revenue was $6.8B, up 18% YoY and 17% QoQ [C5]\n- MI300 progressed well through H1 2024 with customers qualifying workloads and ramping production [C8]\n- MI325 will start in Q4 2024 and ramp more in H1 2025 [C6]\n- MI350 Series will include multiple SKUs ranging from air-cooled to liquid-cooled configurations [C6]\n- AMD expects to reach significant scale with MI450 through partnerships including OCI and DOE [C4]\n- Q4 2024 Data Center guidance described as \"strong double digit\" sequential growth [C4]\n- Both Server and GPU segments grew in Q3, with Server slightly better directionally [C4]\n- CEO commentary on AI demand drivers: Not found in provided sources\n- Specific CEO quotes on AI market opportunity: Not found in provided sources\n Final Answer\nAMD's AI momentum centers on its MI300 accelerator family, which achieved strong production ramp and customer qualification through mid-2024 [C8]. The product roadmap extends through MI325 (Q4 2024 launch, H1 2025 ramp), MI350 Series with air-to-liquid-cooled SKU variants, and MI450 targeting hyperscale deployments with OCI and DOE [C4][C6].\nData Center delivered Q3 2024 revenue contributing to total company revenue of $6.8B (+18% YoY) [C5]. Management guided Q4 Data Center to \"strong double digit\" sequential growth, with both Server and GPU segments contributing, Server slightly outpacing [C4].\nDirect CEO commentary specifically addressing AI demand trends or market sizing was not found in provided sources. The context contains CFO (Jean Hu) responses on guidance and segment performance rather than strategic AI demand commentary from the CEO.",

      "score": 0.65,
      "reasoning": "The answer partially addresses the question by providing relevant AMD financial data and AI product roadmap information from Q3 2024 earnings. However, it explicitly acknowledges that 'Direct CEO commentary specifically addressing AI demand trends' and 'Specific CEO quotes on AI market opportunity' were 'Not found in provided sources.' The answer is honest about this limitation and provides related context about AMD's AI business performance, but it doesn't directly answer what the CEO said about AI demand. The response is relevant to the topic but doesn't fulfill the specific request for CEO statements on AI demand."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.75,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the provided context but contains some issues. The revenue figures ($6.8B, +18% YoY, +17% QoQ) are correctly cited from Chunk 6. The MI300 progress commentary is supported by Chunk 5. The MI325 timing (Q4 start, H1 ramp) and MI350 Series SKU variants are correctly derived from Chunk 7. The MI450 scale with OCI/DOE and the 'strong double digit' guidance are from Chunk 8. However, the answer makes citation references (C4, C5, C6, C8) that don't align with the actual chunk numbers provided (Chunks 1-8), which could cause confusion. Additionally, the answer appropriately acknowledges when information is not found in sources. The core factual claims are supported by the context, but the citation numbering system used in the answer doesn't match the chunk numbering in the context, reducing faithfulness slightly."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.4,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer provides substantial detail about AMD's AI products and financial performance, but it explicitly states that 'Direct CEO commentary specifically addressing AI demand trends or market sizing was not found in provided sources' and 'CEO commentary on AI demand drivers: Not found in provided sources.' The ground truth specifically states that 'AMD CEO Lisa Su emphasized strong AI demand' and 'outlined plans to expand AI product portfolio.' While the generated answer does cover the product roadmap (MI300, MI325, MI350, MI450) which aligns with 'plans to expand AI product portfolio,' it fails to capture the key element about CEO Lisa Su's emphasis on strong AI demand. The answer is factually accurate about what it does cover, but misses the central point about CEO commentary on AI demand that the ground truth highlights."
