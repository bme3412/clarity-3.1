  "question": "How is the cloud computing market affecting Microsoft's business?",
  "ground_truth": "Microsoft Azure continues to show strong growth driven by AI services and enterprise cloud adoption, contributing significantly to overall revenue growth.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts Extracted\n- Azure and other cloud services revenue increased 40% (up 39% in constant currency) in Q1 2026 [C1]\n- Azure and other cloud services revenue increased 39% in Q4 2025 [C2]\n- Intelligent Cloud segment revenue was $30.9B in Q1 2026, up 28% (27% constant currency) [C1]\n- Intelligent Cloud segment revenue was $29.9B in Q4 2025, up 26% (25% constant currency) [C2]\n- Intelligent Cloud segment revenue was $26.8B in Q3 2025, up 21% (22% constant currency) [C3]\n- Intelligent Cloud segment revenue was $25.5B in Q2 2025, up 19% [C4]\n- Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 51% to $392B in Q1 2026 [C1]\n- Microsoft architected Azure for distributed computing fabric emphasizing hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructures [C5]\n- Azure supports low latency access for applications like factory floors, hospitals, and gaming [C5]\n- Microsoft Cloud integrates Azure, Dynamics 365, Microsoft 365, Power Platform, GitHub, and VS Code [C5]\n---\n Final Answer\nAzure demonstrates accelerating growth momentum, with revenue increasing 40% in Q1 2026 [C1], up from 39% in Q4 2025 [C2] and 31% in Q2 2025 [C4]. The Intelligent Cloud segment reached $30.9B in Q1 2026 (+28%) [C1], reflecting sequential expansion from $25.5B in Q2 2025 [C4].\nCommercial remaining performance obligation surged 51% to $392B [C1], signaling robust contracted backlog and forward revenue visibility. This metric indicates sustained enterprise demand for cloud services.\nMicrosoft's architectural strategy positions Azure as a distributed computing fabric supporting hybrid and multi-cloud deployments [C5], enabling low-latency workloads across factory floors, hospitals, and gaming environments [C5]. The integrated Microsoft Cloud stack—spanning Azure, Dynamics 365, Microsoft 365, Power Platform, GitHub, and VS Code—creates cross-selling leverage [C5].\nSpecific market share data versus competitors: Not found in provided sources.

      "score": 0.92,
      "reasoning": "The answer is highly relevant to the question about how cloud computing is affecting Microsoft's business. It provides detailed, specific data about Azure's revenue growth (40% in Q1 2026), Intelligent Cloud segment performance ($30.9B revenue, up 28%), and commercial backlog ($392B, up 51%). The answer also explains Microsoft's strategic positioning in cloud computing with hybrid/multi-cloud architecture. The response directly addresses the business impact through concrete financial metrics and growth trends. It loses a small amount for not providing competitive market share context, but appropriately notes what information was not found in sources."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the provided context. The Azure growth figures (40% Q1 2026, 39% Q4 2025, 33% Q3 2025, 31% Q2 2025) are accurately cited from the chunks. The Intelligent Cloud segment revenues and growth rates are correctly extracted. The $392B commercial remaining performance obligation figure is accurate. The architectural strategy details about distributed computing, hybrid/multi-cloud, and low-latency applications are faithfully derived from Chunk 5/6. However, there is one minor discrepancy: the answer states Azure grew 31% in Q2 2025, but Chunk 1 shows 31% for Q2 2025, which is correct. The answer appropriately acknowledges what information is not found in the sources. The slight deduction is because the answer reorganizes and synthesizes information in ways that add interpretive framing (e.g., 'accelerating growth momentum,' 'cross-selling leverage') that go slightly beyond the literal text, though these interpretations are reasonable inferences from the data."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.7,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer confirms Azure's strong growth with specific metrics (40% revenue increase, Intelligent Cloud reaching $30.9B with 28% growth), which aligns with the ground truth's claim of 'strong growth.' The answer also mentions enterprise cloud adoption through metrics like commercial remaining performance obligation (+51% to $392B). However, the generated answer explicitly states that 'AI-specific revenue contribution: Not found in provided sources,' while the ground truth specifically attributes growth to 'AI services.' This is a notable gap since the ground truth emphasizes AI as a key driver. The generated answer provides more detail on growth metrics but fails to confirm the AI services component mentioned in the ground truth."
