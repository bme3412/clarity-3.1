  "question": "How many MI325X units did AMD ship in 2022?",
  "ground_truth": "Not found in provided sources.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts Extracted:\n- MI325X: Not mentioned in 2022 context; first reference appears in 2024 Q3 context [C7]\n- GPU shipments for 2022: Not found in provided sources\n- Unit sales for 2022: Not found in provided sources\n---\nMI325X, GPU shipments, unit sales for 2022: Not found in provided sources.\nThe MI325X GPU is referenced only in 2024 Q3 materials as a product in AMD's roadmap alongside MI350-series and MI400 series [C7]. The 2022 financial data [C1–C4] contains quarterly revenue, margins, and earnings but does not include GPU-specific shipment volumes or unit sales figures. The 2022 earnings call transcripts [C10–C13] discuss market conditions, supply constraints, and segment commentary but provide no quantitative GPU unit data.",

  "metrics": {
    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is relevant and addresses the question appropriately. It correctly identifies that MI325X was not a product in 2022 (it appeared in 2024), and explains that the 2022 financial data does not contain GPU-specific shipment volumes. While it doesn't provide a direct numerical answer, this is because the information doesn't exist - the product wasn't available in 2022. The answer demonstrates thorough research of the available sources and provides helpful context about when MI325X actually appeared and what information is available in the 2022 data."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.9,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the provided context. It correctly states that MI325X is not mentioned in 2022 context and only appears in later materials (Chunk 10 shows MI325X in what appears to be 2024 context). The answer accurately notes that the 2022 financial data (Chunks 1-4) contains quarterly revenue, margins, and earnings but no GPU-specific shipment data. The claim about 2022 earnings call transcripts discussing market conditions and supply constraints is supported by Chunks 5-8. The only minor issue is the citation format [C7] doesn't match the chunk numbers provided, but the substantive claims are accurate. The answer appropriately acknowledges what information is not available in the context rather than hallucinating data."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the information is 'Not found in provided sources,' which matches the ground truth. The generated answer provides additional context and detail about why the information wasn't found (MI325X only appears in 2024 materials, 2022 data doesn't include GPU-specific shipment volumes), but this additional detail is consistent with and supports the ground truth conclusion. The answer is factually accurate in stating the requested information is not available."
