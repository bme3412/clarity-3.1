  "ground_truth": "Not found in provided sources.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts Extracted\n- AWS revenue guidance for 2026: Not found in provided sources.\n- AWS 2026 revenue projections: Not found in provided sources.\n- Any forward guidance specifically for fiscal year 2026: Not found in provided sources.\n---\n Final Answer\nAWS revenue guidance for 2026: Not found in provided sources.\nThe provided context contains historical AWS performance data through Q3 2025 and Q4 2024, including segment margins and operating income figures, but does not include any forward revenue guidance or projections specifically for fiscal year 2026. The context references AWS growth momentum [C1], segment margins declining from 39.5% to 32.9% in Q2 2025 [C2], and historical quarterly results [C3][C4], but no 2026 guidance is present.",

  "metrics": {
    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.9,
      "reasoning": "The answer directly addresses the question by clearly stating that AWS revenue guidance for 2026 was not found in the provided sources. It explains what information was available (historical data through Q3 2025) and explicitly confirms the absence of 2026 forward guidance. This is a relevant and complete response to the yes/no question, effectively answering 'No, Amazon did not provide 2026 AWS revenue guidance' based on the available context."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer correctly states that AWS revenue guidance for 2026 is not found in the provided sources. The context contains historical data from Q3 2024, Q4 2024, and references to Q1-Q3 2025, including AWS operating margins, operating income ($10.2 billion), and growth momentum statements. However, there is no forward-looking revenue guidance specifically for fiscal year 2026 in any of the chunks. The answer faithfully reflects what is and isn't present in the context without adding any hallucinated information."

    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that AWS revenue guidance for 2026 is not found in the provided sources, which matches the ground truth. The generated answer provides additional context about what information IS available (historical data through Q3 2025, Q4 2024, segment margins, etc.) and explains why the specific 2026 guidance cannot be found. This additional detail is consistent with and supports the core finding that matches the ground truth."
