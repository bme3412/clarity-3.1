  "question": "What was Microsoft’s Copilot revenue in Q1 2022?",
  "ground_truth": "Not found in provided sources.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts Extracted\n- Q1 2022 total revenue: $45.3B (YoY +22%, constant currency +20%) [C12]\n- Q1 2022 revenue (alternate source): $45,317M [C1]\n- Q1 2022 revenue growth: 22% [C1]\n- Gross profit: $31,671M [C1]\n- Gross margin: 69.9% [C1]\n- Operating income: $20,238M [C1]\n- Operating margin: 44.7% [C1]\n- Net income: $20,505M [C1]\n- Operating cash flow: $24,540M [C1]\n- Copilot revenue or metrics for Q1 2022: Not found in provided sources\n---\n Final Answer\nCopilot revenue for Q1 2022: Not found in provided sources. The provided context contains no mention of Copilot or any associated revenue figures for this period.\nQ1 2022 Total Company Revenue: $45.3B (YoY +22% / constant currency +20%) [C12]\nSupporting financials:\n- Gross margin: 69.9% [C1]\n- Operating income: $20.2B, operating margin 44.7% [C1]\n- Net income: $20.5B [C1]\n- Operating cash flow: $24.5B [C1]\nMicrosoft Cloud strategy during this quarter emphasized Azure, Dynamics 365, Microsoft 365, Power Platform, GitHub, and VS Code integration, with industry clouds adding sector-specific value [C2][C6]. Azure consumption growth remained consistent with reduced seasonality [C10]. Large enterprise commitments were driven by comprehensive cloud offerings across the product suite [C4][C7].\nNote: Copilot as a commercial product was not yet launched in Q1 FY2022; the context contains no Copilot-specific data.",
  "duration_ms": 12698,
  "metrics": {
    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is highly relevant to the question. It directly addresses that Copilot revenue for Q1 2022 was not found in the provided sources, and importantly notes that Copilot as a commercial product was not yet launched in Q1 FY2022. This is a valid and informative response to the question. The answer also provides helpful context by sharing the overall Q1 2022 revenue figures. The slight deduction is because the answer includes extensive additional financial details that weren't specifically asked for, though this context is still useful."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The answer is highly faithful to the provided context. All financial figures cited (revenue $45.3B/45,317M, 22% growth, gross profit $31,671M, gross margin 69.9%, operating income $20,238M, operating margin 44.7%, net income $20,505M, operating cash flow $24,540M) are directly found in Chunks 1 and 12. The Microsoft Cloud strategy details about Azure, Dynamics 365, Microsoft 365, Power Platform, GitHub, and VS Code integration are accurately drawn from Chunks 2 and 6. The statement about Azure seasonality decreasing comes from Chunk 10, and large enterprise commitments information comes from Chunks 4 and 7. The answer correctly acknowledges that Copilot revenue is not found in the provided sources, which is accurate - there is no mention of Copilot in any chunk. The only minor deduction is for the note about Copilot not being launched yet, which is external knowledge not explicitly stated in the context, though it's presented as a clarifying note rather than a factual claim from the sources."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that Copilot revenue/metrics for Q1 2022 was 'Not found in provided sources,' which matches the ground truth. While the generated answer provides extensive additional context about Q1 2022 financials and explains why Copilot data isn't available (it wasn't launched yet), the core factual claim aligns with the ground truth. The additional information is consistent and accurate, and the answer explicitly states the same conclusion as the ground truth regarding the specific query about Copilot."
