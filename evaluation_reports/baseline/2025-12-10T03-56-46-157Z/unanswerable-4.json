  "question": "What was Meta's Reality Labs operating loss in Q1 2017?",
  "ground_truth": "Not found in provided sources.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts Extracted:\n- None of the provided context contains information about Reality Labs operating loss for Q1 2017.\n- [C1] discusses AI glasses and Reality Labs in the context of 2025 Q3.\n- [C2] provides Reality Labs revenue of $0.47B with +74% YoY change for 2025 Q3, not Q1 2017.\n---\nFinal Answer:\nNot found in provided sources.\nThe context provided contains only 2025 Q3 data for Reality Labs, including revenue of $0.47B (+74% YoY) [C2]. No Q1 2017 Reality Labs operating loss data is available in the provided sources. Note that Reality Labs as a separately reported segment did not exist in Meta's financial reporting structure in Q1 2017.",

    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is relevant and appropriately addresses the question. It correctly states that the information was not found in the provided sources and provides helpful context explaining why (Reality Labs wasn't a separately reported segment in Q1 2017). The answer demonstrates good research practice by explaining what data was available and why the specific requested data couldn't be found. It loses some points because the primary response is 'not found' rather than providing the actual answer, but this is appropriate given the data limitations."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer is completely faithful to the provided context. The response correctly identifies that the context only contains 2025 Q3 data for Reality Labs (revenue of $0.47B with +74% YoY change from Chunk 2), and accurately states that no Q1 2017 data is present in the sources. The answer appropriately declines to provide information not found in the context rather than hallucinating data. The additional note about Reality Labs not existing as a separate segment in 2017 is reasonable contextual knowledge that doesn't contradict the provided sources."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the information is not found in the provided sources, which matches the ground truth. The generated answer provides additional helpful context explaining why the information isn't available (the data is from 2025 Q3, not Q1 2017, and Reality Labs wasn't a separately reported segment in 2017), but this additional detail is consistent with and supports the core answer that the requested information is not available."
