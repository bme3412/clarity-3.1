The QoQ growth of +17% is directly from Chunk 12. The statement that Data Center accounts for more than 50% of revenue mix is directly quoted from Chunk 4. The only minor issue is the answer states Data Center drives 'margin expansion' which is implied but not explicitly stated in the same sentence in C4 - the context says it 'helps us to improve gross margin' which supports this claim.

The $1.5B Data Center GPU estimate is supported by C4 and C7. However, there are minor issues: (1) The QoQ change of +17% appears in C12 but the chunk shows '+17%' which matches, though C1 shows 17.6% revenue growth which may cause slight confusion. (2) The claim about Q4 needing ~$2B for sequential growth is supported by C4, but the extrapolation to '$5.2B-$5.3B' is analyst speculation from C6, not management guidance - the answer presents this somewhat as fact. (3) The answer correctly notes that segment operating income/margin for Data Center alone was not found.

For example, the context mentions 'investing in software' and 'software stack development' as challenges, but the answer frames this as 'aggressive investment' and 'centers on' which adds emphasis not present in the source. The context also doesn't explicitly state that software is the key to 'capturing the next wave of AI customers' - it mentions it as a challenge for 'customer ramp' but the framing is somewhat embellished.

It also references strong performance and growth metrics. However, the generated answer does not explicitly attribute these statements to CEO Lisa Su, and notably ends with 'Specific CEO commentary on AI demand drivers... Not found in provided sources.' This contradicts the ground truth which specifically mentions Lisa Su's emphasis on strong AI demand. The answer provides more detail on product specifics and financial metrics, but misses the core attribution to the CEO and the explicit framing of 'strong AI demand' as a key emphasis point."

However, the question specifically asks for 'revenue guidance for upcoming quarters' - meaning explicit numerical forecasts for future quarters. The answer honestly acknowledges at the end that 'Explicit numerical forward guidance for upcoming quarters: Not found in provided sources.'

Revenue figures for FY2026 Q3 ($57.006B), Q2 ($46.743B), and FY2025 Q4 ($39.331B) are accurately extracted from the context. The $0.5T Blackwell/Rubin visibility claim is correctly attributed to Jensen Huang from Chunk 4. The networking revenue figures ($8.2B and $7.3B) are supported by Chunks 4 and 6. However, there are minor issues: (1) The FY2026 Q1 revenue of $44.062B is correctly stated but the YoY +69% growth rate is not explicitly stated in the context - Chunk 10 shows Q1 FY2026 revenue but doesn't state 69% growth; (2) The claim about GB300 production at '1,000 racks per week' and 'Blackwell Ultra generating tens of billions' is attributed to C9 but actually appears in Chunk 6 (Q2 transcript), not Chunk 9; (3) The nine-month revenue comparison is accurate from Chunk 12. The answer appropriately notes that explicit numerical forward guidance for upcoming quarters was not found, which is accurate. Overall, the answer demonstrates good faithfulness with minor attribution errors and one unsupported growth percentage."

The CEO's statement about $0.5T in Blackwell/Rubin revenue pipeline and AI infrastructure spending scaling to hundreds of billions aligns with 'continued AI infrastructure demand.' However, the generated answer explicitly states 'Explicit numerical forward guidance for upcoming quarters: Not found in provided sources,' which somewhat contradicts the ground truth's assertion about 'optimistic guidance.' The answer demonstrates strong data center/AI-related growth but doesn't specifically mention 'data center revenue' as the ground truth does. The overall narrative supports optimism and AI-driven growth, but the explicit disclaimer about missing forward guidance prevents a higher score."
