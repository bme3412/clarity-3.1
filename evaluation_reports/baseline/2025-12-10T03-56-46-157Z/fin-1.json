  "question": "What was AMD's total revenue in Q3 2024?",
  "ground_truth": "AMD's total revenue in Q3 2024 was $6.8 billion, representing an 18% increase year-over-year.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts Extracted:\n- Q3 2024 total revenue: $6,819M ($6.8B) [C1][C12]\n- Year-over-year revenue growth: +17.6% [C1] / +18% [C12]\n- Quarter-over-quarter revenue growth: +17% [C12]\n- Data Center accounts for more than 50% of revenue mix [C4]\n---\nRevenue: $6.8B (YoY +18% / QoQ +17%) [C1][C12]\nData Center now exceeds 50% of total revenue mix, driving both top-line growth and margin expansion [C4].",

    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The answer directly addresses the question about AMD's total revenue in Q3 2024, providing the specific figure of $6,819M ($6.8B) with supporting details about year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth. The answer is comprehensive and includes relevant context about revenue composition. Minor deduction for including some additional information beyond what was asked, but the core question is fully answered."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The answer is highly faithful to the provided context. The revenue figure of $6,819M/$6.8B is directly supported by Chunk 1 (revenue: 6819) and Chunk 12 (total_revenue value: 6.8 billion USD). The YoY growth figures of +17.6% (C1) and +18% (C12) are both present in the context, though there's a slight discrepancy between sources which the answer acknowledges by citing both. The QoQ growth of +17% is directly from Chunk 12. The statement that Data Center accounts for more than 50% of revenue mix is directly quoted from Chunk 4. The only minor issue is the answer states Data Center drives 'margin expansion' which is implied but not explicitly stated in the same sentence in C4 - the context says it 'helps us to improve gross margin' which supports this claim. Overall, the answer contains no hallucinations and all facts are traceable to the provided context."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly states AMD's Q3 2024 total revenue as $6.8 billion (also shown as $6,819M) and the year-over-year increase as 18% (with a more precise 17.6% also mentioned). These key facts match the ground truth exactly. The generated answer provides additional accurate details about quarter-over-quarter growth and data center revenue mix, which is consistent with providing more detail while maintaining factual accuracy."
