Revenue growth has stabilized at 18% YoY across 2025 quarters, a notable acceleration from the 12% growth and $92B annualized run rate reported in Q3 2023 [C6]. Operating income growth decelerated from 48% YoY in Q4 2024 [C4] to single-digit growth in 2025, reflecting margin compression from Q1 2025's peak of 39.5% to Q2 2025's trough of 32.9% before recovering to 34.6% in Q3 2025 [C1][C2][C3]. AWS launched the European Sovereign Cloud to serve public sector and regulated industries [C5], while generative AI and large language model investments continue positioning AWS as a cloud infrastructure leader [C6][C7].",

      "score": 0.4,
      "reasoning": "The answer provides extensive detail about AWS's performance metrics (revenue, operating income, margins) across multiple quarters. However, it fails to adequately address the core question about how AWS compares to 'overall company growth.' The answer lacks any data about Amazon's total company revenue growth, consolidated operating income growth, or other segment performance that would enable a meaningful comparison. To properly answer the question, the response should have included Amazon's overall growth rates alongside AWS metrics to show the relative performance."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.3,
      "reasoning": "The answer contains significant hallucinations and misattributes data from the context. The context shows AWS quarterly net sales figures (e.g., $33,006M for Q3 2025, $30,873M for Q2 2025, $29,267M for Q1 2025), but the answer incorrectly cites these as much larger figures ($121,932M, $116,378M, $111,786M) which are actually the TTM (trailing twelve months) cumulative figures, not quarterly net sales. The answer also misrepresents operating income figures - for example, Q3 2025 operating income is $11,434M in the context, which the answer correctly states, but the context shows this is from the TTM row, not quarterly. The quarterly AWS operating income figures in the context are different (e.g., around $10-11B range). Additionally, the 18% YoY growth cited for net sales appears to be from the TTM figures, not quarterly growth rates which show 17-20% in the context. The $92B annualized run rate from Q3 2023 is correctly cited from Chunk 4. While some facts are present in the context, the systematic misattribution of TTM figures as quarterly figures represents a significant faithfulness issue."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.6,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer provides extensive factual data about AWS financial performance with specific numbers and growth rates, which supports the ground truth's claim that AWS is a 'key profit driver' (shown by the substantial operating income figures). The 18% YoY growth rates align with the 'growth rates driven by cloud adoption' aspect. The mention of 'generative AI and large language model investments' partially addresses the 'AI services' component. However, the generated answer completely omits any mention of 'competitive pressure from Azure and Google Cloud' which is a key element of the ground truth. The answer is factually consistent with what it covers but fails to address the competitive landscape aspect entirely."

They see that partnering with AWS and moving to the cloud gives them better cost, better capability and better speed of innovation.",
