    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.8,
      "reasoning": "The answer is relevant to the question as it directly addresses the query about Meta's Reality Labs operating loss in Q1 2017. The response correctly acknowledges that the information is not available in the provided sources and explains what data is actually available (Q3 2025 data). This is an appropriate and honest response when the requested information cannot be found, making it relevant even though it doesn't provide the specific number requested."

    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer is completely faithful to the provided context. The generated answer correctly identifies that the requested information (Reality Labs operating loss for Q1 2017) is not present in the provided sources. The context only contains Q3 2025 data, including Reality Labs revenue of $0.47B with +74% YoY growth, which the answer accurately references. The answer appropriately states 'Not found in provided sources' rather than hallucinating information about Q1 2017 data that doesn't exist in the context."

    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the information is not found in the provided sources, which matches the ground truth. While the generated answer provides additional context about what data IS available (Q3 2025 data), this extra detail is consistent with and supports the core finding that Q1 2017 Reality Labs data is not available. The answer is accurate and does not contradict the ground truth."
