  "ground_truth": "Not found in provided sources.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts Extracted\n- Not found in provided sources: FY2015 gaming revenue\n- Not found in provided sources: FY2015 segment revenue breakdown\n- Context [C1] and [C2] contain only Q3 FY2026 data, not FY2015 data\n---\nGaming Revenue (FY2015): Not found in provided sources.\nSegment Revenue (FY2015): Not found in provided sources.\nThe provided context contains only Q3 FY2026 financial data [C2], which shows total revenue of $57.0B with +62% YoY growth [C2].

  "duration_ms": 9342,
  "metrics": {
    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.6,
      "reasoning": "The answer is relevant to the question in that it directly addresses the query about FY2015 gaming revenue. It correctly acknowledges that the requested information is not available in the provided sources and explains why (sources only contain Q3 FY2026 data). While the answer doesn't provide the actual FY2015 gaming revenue figure, it appropriately responds to the question by indicating the data limitation. The score is not higher because the answer doesn't actually answer the question with the requested information, but it's not irrelevant since it directly engages with the query."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the context. It correctly identifies that the provided context does not contain FY2015 data and accurately notes that the context only contains Q3 FY2026 financial information. The answer correctly cites the $57.0B revenue figure and +62% YoY growth from Chunk 2. The answer appropriately states 'Not found in provided sources' for the FY2015 data rather than hallucinating information. However, a small deduction is made because the answer references '[C1]' and '[C2]' notation which wasn't explicitly in the original context format, and the answer could have been more concise in simply stating the information wasn't available rather than repeating the 'not found' statement multiple times."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the FY2015 information is not found in the provided sources, which matches the ground truth. While the generated answer provides additional context about what data IS available (Q3 FY2026 data), this extra detail is consistent with and supports the core finding that FY2015 data is unavailable. The answer does not contradict the ground truth in any way."
