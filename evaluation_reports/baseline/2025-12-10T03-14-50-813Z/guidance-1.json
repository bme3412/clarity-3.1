      "reasoning": "The user asked specifically about revenue GUIDANCE for upcoming quarters, which refers to forward-looking projections or forecasts provided by the company. The answer primarily provides historical revenue data (Q1-Q3 FY26 actual results) rather than guidance. It explicitly states 'Explicit Q4 FY26 revenue guidance: Not found in provided sources' twice, acknowledging the guidance was not found. While the answer does mention forward visibility to $0.5T in cumulative Blackwell/Rubin revenue and qualitative demand commentary, it fails to provide the specific numerical revenue guidance for upcoming quarters that the user was asking about. The response is partially relevant but does not directly answer the question about upcoming quarter guidance."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the provided context, with most claims properly supported by citations. The revenue figures for Q3 FY26 ($57.006B), Q2 FY26 ($46.743B), and Q1 FY26 ($44.062B) are accurately extracted from the context. The $0.5T Blackwell/Rubin visibility claim is directly from Chunk 1 (Jensen Huang's statement). The networking revenue of $8.2B with 162% YoY growth is correctly cited from Chunk 1. The GB300 production rate of 1,000 racks per week is found in Chunk 3 (not Chunk 6 as cited, but the information is present). The Rubin roadmap information is accurately derived from the context. However, there are minor issues: (1) The citation [C5] for Q3 revenue should reference the financial data chunks, not Chunk 5 which contains different information; (2) The Q4 FY26 guidance of $65B is actually present in Chunk 4 ('q4_guidance': 'revenue': '65.0 ±2% billion USD') but the answer states it was 'not found' - this is a factual error/omission. The answer correctly acknowledges when information is not found for some items, but missed the Q4 guidance that was available."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.7,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer supports the ground truth's claim about optimistic guidance and continued AI infrastructure demand. It provides extensive evidence of strong growth (62% YoY revenue growth, 'off the charts' Blackwell demand, $0.5T visibility in future revenue, 162% networking growth). However, the generated answer explicitly states 'Explicit Q4 FY26 revenue guidance: Not found in provided sources,' which means it doesn't directly confirm specific forward guidance figures. The answer demonstrates sustained growth in data center-related revenue through networking and AI infrastructure metrics, which aligns with the ground truth. The score is reduced slightly because while the evidence strongly implies optimistic outlook, the explicit guidance statement is missing."
