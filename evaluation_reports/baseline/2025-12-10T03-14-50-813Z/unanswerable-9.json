  "question": "Did Broadcom report FY2016 networking segment revenue?",
  "ground_truth": "Not found in provided sources.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts Extracted:\n- Not found in provided sources. [C1, C2 contain only FY2025 Q3 data, with no FY2016 networking segment revenue or segment revenue figures]\n---\nFinal Answer:\nNot found in provided sources. The provided context contains only Q3 FY2025 financial data, including total revenue of $15,952M and segment breakdowns for that quarter [C1][C2]. No FY2016 networking segment revenue or total segment revenue data is available in the materials provided.",

    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.8,
      "reasoning": "The answer is relevant to the question as it directly addresses whether FY2016 networking segment revenue was reported. The answer correctly states that the information was not found in the provided sources and explains why (only FY2025 Q3 data was available). While it doesn't confirm whether Broadcom actually reported this figure in their original FY2016 filings, it appropriately responds based on the available context. The answer is honest about the limitations of the source material."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer is completely faithful to the provided context. The system correctly identified that the context only contains Q3 FY2025 financial data (total revenue of $15,952M) and does not contain any FY2016 networking segment revenue information. The answer appropriately states 'Not found in provided sources' rather than hallucinating information about FY2016 data that is not present in the context. This demonstrates proper handling of a query that cannot be answered from the available context."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the information is not found in the provided sources, which matches the ground truth. The generated answer provides additional context explaining why the information isn't available (the sources only contain FY2025 Q3 data, not FY2016 data), which is consistent with and more detailed than the ground truth answer."
