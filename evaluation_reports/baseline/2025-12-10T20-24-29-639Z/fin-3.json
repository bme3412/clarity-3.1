  "question": "How has Nvidia's data center revenue changed over the past year?",
  "ground_truth": "Nvidia's data center revenue has grown significantly, driven by AI GPU demand. The segment has shown consistent triple-digit growth rates throughout FY2024-2025.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n- Q4 2025 data center revenue: $35.6B with +16% QoQ growth and +93% YoY growth [C1]\n- Q3 2025 data center revenue: $30.8B with +17% QoQ growth and +112% YoY growth [C2]  \n- Q2 2025 data center revenue: $26.3B with +16% QoQ growth and +154% YoY growth [C3]\n- Q4 2024 data center revenue: $18.4B, up 27% QoQ and up 409% YoY [C5]\n- Q3 2024 data center revenue: $14.5B, up 41% sequentially and up 279% YoY [C6]\n- Full-year 2024 data center revenue: $47.5B, up 217% [C5]\n Final Answer:\nData center revenue: $35.6B (YoY +93% / QoQ +16%) [C1]\nNVIDIA's data center revenue has shown explosive growth over the past year. Starting from $18.4B in Q4 2024 [C5], revenue nearly doubled to $35.6B in Q4 2025 [C1]. The segment maintained strong sequential momentum with consistent double-digit quarterly growth: +27% in Q4 2024 [C5], followed by +16% in Q2 2025 [C3], +17% in Q3 2025 [C2], and +16% in Q4 2025 [C1].\nYear-over-year comparisons show accelerating growth rates: 409% in Q4 2024 [C5], 154% in Q2 2025 [C3], 112% in Q3 2025 [C2], and 93% in Q4 2025 [C1]. While YoY growth rates have moderated from peak levels due to higher comparison bases, the absolute revenue increases remain substantial. Full-year 2024 data center revenue reached $47.5B, representing 217% growth [C5].",

      "reasoning": "The answer directly and comprehensively addresses the question about Nvidia's data center revenue changes over the past year. It provides specific quarterly revenue figures (Q4 2024 through Q4 2025), both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth percentages, and full-year totals. The answer shows the trajectory from $18.4B to $35.6B with detailed growth metrics, giving a complete picture of how the revenue has changed over the specified time period."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.75,
      "reasoning": "The answer contains mostly accurate information from the context but has some issues. The data center revenue figures are correctly cited: $35.6B for Q4 2025 with +16% QoQ and +93% YoY [C1], $30.8B (actually 30,771) for Q3 2025 [C3], $26.3B (actually 26,272) for Q2 2025 [C4], and $18.4B for Q4 2024 [C8]. However, the answer incorrectly attributes Q3 2024 data center revenue of $14.5B to [C6], when this information actually comes from [C5]. The context in [C5] mentions '$14.5 billion, up 41% sequentially and up 279% year-on-year' for data center revenue. Additionally, the answer references fiscal quarters (Q4 2025, Q3 2025, etc.) but the context doesn't explicitly label these quarters - the answer infers the quarter labels. The full-year 2024 data center revenue of $47.5B and 217% growth is correctly cited from [C8]. Some minor rounding differences exist (30,771 vs 30.8B, 26,272 vs 26.3B). Overall, the core financial data is faithful to the context with minor citation errors and reasonable rounding."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer strongly supports the ground truth's claim that Nvidia's data center revenue has grown significantly driven by AI GPU demand. The answer provides extensive specific data showing substantial growth. However, there's a slight discrepancy: the ground truth states 'consistent triple-digit growth rates throughout FY2024-2025,' but the generated answer shows that Q4 2025 YoY growth was 93% (double-digit, not triple-digit). The answer shows triple-digit YoY growth in earlier quarters (409%, 279%, 154%, 112%) but the most recent quarter dropped to 93%. This is a minor factual inconsistency with the 'throughout' claim in the ground truth. The generated answer is much more detailed and provides specific numbers, which is valuable, but it reveals that growth rates have moderated below triple digits in the latest quarter."
