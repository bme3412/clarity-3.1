  "question": "Did Amazon provide 2026 AWS revenue guidance?",
  "ground_truth": "Not found in provided sources.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n• No 2026 AWS revenue guidance found in provided sources [C1-C10]\n• Financial data available only through 2025 Q3 with total revenue of $180.2B [C1]\n• AWS segment-specific revenue data not found in provided sources [C1-C10]\n• 2024 CapEx guidance mentioned increase year-over-year for AWS and generative AI infrastructure [C5]\n• Historical quarterly data available for 2020-2025 but no forward-looking AWS revenue guidance beyond 2024 CapEx [C1-C10]\n Final Answer:\nNot found in provided sources.\nThe provided context contains Amazon's financial data through 2025 Q3 with total revenue of $180.2B (YoY +13.4%) [C1], but does not include any 2026 AWS revenue guidance. While there is mention of 2024 CapEx guidance anticipating increases for AWS and generative AI infrastructure investments [C5], no specific AWS revenue projections for 2026 are present in the available sources.",

      "score": 0.9,
      "reasoning": "The answer directly addresses the question about whether Amazon provided 2026 AWS revenue guidance. It clearly states that no such guidance was found in the provided sources, and provides relevant context about what financial data IS available (through Q3 2025, CapEx guidance for 2024, etc.). The answer is relevant, responsive, and appropriately acknowledges the limitations of the available information. It loses a small amount because the ideal answer would be more concise, but it does effectively answer the question."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer correctly states that no 2026 AWS revenue guidance is found in the provided sources, which is accurate. The answer appropriately cites the financial data from Chunk 1 showing revenue of $180,169 (interpreted as $180.2B) with 13.4% growth. The reference to 2024 CapEx guidance for AWS infrastructure is accurately drawn from Chunk 8. However, the answer makes some minor interpretive leaps - the chunks don't explicitly label the data as '2025 Q3' (the dates aren't clearly specified in the financial chunks), and the answer presents the revenue figure with slight formatting differences. The core claim that no 2026 AWS guidance exists is faithful to the context, and the answer appropriately acknowledges the limitations of the available data rather than hallucinating information."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the information is 'Not found in provided sources,' which matches the ground truth exactly. The generated answer provides additional context about what data IS available (financial data through 2025 Q3, 2024 CapEx guidance), but this additional detail is consistent with and supports the core finding that 2026 AWS revenue guidance is not available. The answer does not contradict the ground truth in any way."
