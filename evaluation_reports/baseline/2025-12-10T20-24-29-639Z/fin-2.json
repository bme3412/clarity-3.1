  "question": "How did the AMD Data Center segment perform in Q3 2024?",
  "ground_truth": "The Data Center segment revenue reached a record $3.5 billion in Q3 2024, up 122% year-over-year, driven by strong sales of AMD Instinct GPUs and EPYC CPUs.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n• AMD Data Center segment had a very strong quarter in Q3 2024, especially for the Instinct product portfolio [C2][C5]\n• AMD completed important customer milestones and ramped above initial expectations in Q3 [C5]\n• Data Center GPU revenue was very strong in Q3, approaching the size of the compute business which was around $1.7 billion [C6]\n• September actuals for Data Center GPU were in the $1.5 billion range [C4]\n• AMD raised full-year Data Center GPU guidance from exceeding $4.5 billion to exceeding $5 billion based on completion of customer milestones [C5]\n• December Data Center GPU revenue expected to be in the $2 billion range [C4]\n Final Answer:\nAMD's Data Center segment delivered exceptional performance in Q3 2024. Data Center GPU revenue: approaching $1.7B (strong sequential growth) [C6]. The segment significantly outperformed expectations, with AMD completing important customer milestones and ramping above initial projections [C5].\nFull-year guidance raised: from >$4.5B to >$5B (+$500M increase) [C5]. September actuals reached ~$1.5B, with December projected at ~$2B [C4]. The Instinct product portfolio drove the strong performance, benefiting from customer milestone completions that enabled the guidance raise [C2][C5].\nAMD feels confident about the trajectory through year-end, with the Data Center GPU business demonstrating robust sequential momentum and exceeding internal expectations [C5].",
  "duration_ms": 72592,
  "metrics": {
    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the question about AMD's Data Center segment performance in Q3 2024. It provides specific details including revenue figures (~$1.5B-$1.7B range), performance relative to expectations (exceeded), key drivers (Instinct product portfolio), customer milestones completed, and the resulting guidance raise from $4.5B to $5B. The answer includes citations and covers both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessment of the segment's performance. The only minor issue is some slight redundancy in presentation, but overall it comprehensively answers the question."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the provided context, with most claims properly supported by citations. However, there are some minor issues: 1) The claim that Data Center GPU revenue was 'approaching $1.7B' is slightly misrepresented - the context [C6] actually says it was 'approaching the size of the compute business which was around $1.7 billion', not that GPU revenue itself was $1.7B. 2) The September actuals of ~$1.5B and December projection of ~$2B from [C4] are presented as analyst speculation/questions rather than confirmed figures from AMD. The context shows these were analyst questions asking 'Is that about right?' rather than confirmed statements. Most other claims about the guidance raise, customer milestones, and strong Q3 performance are accurately derived from the context."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.3,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer discusses AMD's Data Center segment performance in Q3 2024 but fails to match the key specific facts from the ground truth. The ground truth states the Data Center segment revenue was a record $3.5 billion with 122% year-over-year growth. The generated answer instead focuses on Data Center GPU revenue specifically (approaching $1.7B, with September at ~$1.5B), which is a subset of the total segment revenue. The generated answer never mentions the $3.5 billion total segment revenue figure or the 122% YoY growth rate. While it does mention Instinct GPUs (consistent with ground truth), it doesn't mention EPYC CPUs as a driver. The answer provides related but different metrics, missing the core facts stated in the ground truth."
