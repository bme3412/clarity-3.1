  "question": "How did the AMD Data Center segment perform in Q3 2024?",
  "ground_truth": "The Data Center segment revenue reached a record $3.5 billion in Q3 2024, up 122% year-over-year, driven by strong sales of AMD Instinct GPUs and EPYC CPUs.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n• Data Center GPU revenue was approximately $1.5 billion in Q3 2024 [C4]\n• Data Center GPU revenue was approaching the size of AMD's compute business, which was around $1.7 billion [C6]\n• AMD had a very strong quarter for the Data Center overall in Q3 and especially for the Instinct product portfolio [C5]\n• AMD completed important customer milestones and ramped above initial expectations for Data Center GPU [C5]\n• AMD raised full-year Data Center GPU guidance from exceeding $4.5 billion to exceeding $5 billion [C5]\n• The guidance increase was based on completion of customer milestones [C5]\n Final Answer:\nData Center GPU Revenue: ~$1.5B (approaching compute business size of ~$1.7B) [C4][C6]\nAMD delivered a very strong Data Center quarter in Q3 2024, particularly for the Instinct product portfolio [C5]. The company completed important customer milestones and ramped above initial expectations [C5]. Based on this strong performance, AMD raised its full-year Data Center GPU guidance from exceeding $4.5 billion to exceeding $5 billion [C5].\nSpecific segment margins and year-over-year/quarter-over-quarter growth rates: Not found in provided sources.",
  "duration_ms": 12810,

    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is highly relevant to the question about AMD's Data Center segment performance in Q3 2024. It provides specific revenue figures (~$1.5B for Data Center GPU), mentions strong overall performance, discusses customer milestones, and notes the raised full-year guidance from $4.5B to $5B. The answer is well-structured with citations. However, it acknowledges that specific segment margins and growth rates were not found, which slightly limits completeness. The answer directly addresses the question with concrete data points about Q3 2024 performance."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the provided context. The $1.5 billion Q3 figure is correctly attributed to analyst questions in C4 and C6 (though these are analyst estimates/questions, not confirmed figures). The strong quarter performance, customer milestones, and guidance raise from $4.5B to $5B are accurately cited from C5. The answer appropriately notes that specific segment margins and growth rates were not found in the sources. However, the answer presents the $1.5B figure as more definitive than the context supports - the context shows this was an analyst's estimate/question ('It seems like it was in the $1.5 billion range'), not a confirmed company statement. This slight overstatement of certainty prevents a perfect score."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.3,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer provides different figures than the ground truth. The ground truth states Data Center segment revenue was $3.5 billion with 122% YoY growth, while the generated answer claims Data Center GPU revenue was approximately $1.5 billion. These are different metrics (total segment revenue vs. GPU-specific revenue), and the generated answer fails to mention the key $3.5 billion figure or the 122% growth rate. The generated answer does provide some accurate contextual information about strong performance and raised guidance, but misses the core factual claims in the ground truth. The answer also explicitly states that YoY growth rates were 'not found' when the ground truth specifies 122%."
