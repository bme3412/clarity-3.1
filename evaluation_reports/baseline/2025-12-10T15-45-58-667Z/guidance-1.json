Management indicates Blackwell demand is \"off the charts\" with visibility to $0.5T in Blackwell/Rubin revenue as AI infrastructure spend reaches hundreds of billions [C4]. GB300 has crossed over GB200 in demand, while networking surged to $8.2B with 162% YoY growth [C4]. Gaming remains pressured with sequential decline, though data center's 93% YoY growth more than offsets weakness.\nForward guidance: Not found in provided sources.",

      "reasoning": "The user asked specifically about revenue GUIDANCE for upcoming quarters (forward-looking projections). The answer primarily provides historical/reported results for Q2-Q4 2025, not forward guidance. The answer does acknowledge 'Forward guidance: Not found in provided sources' which is honest, but the bulk of the response discusses past performance rather than addressing the actual question about future guidance. The mention of '$0.5T in Blackwell/Rubin revenue' visibility is somewhat relevant to forward outlook but is not specific quarterly guidance. The answer is partially relevant but largely misses the mark on what was actually asked."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the provided context, with most claims properly supported by the chunks. The revenue figures ($39.3B, $35.1B, $30.0B), data center numbers, gaming figures, and margin percentages are accurately extracted from Chunks 1-3. The Blackwell demand being 'off the charts', $0.5T visibility, GB300 crossing GB200, and networking $8.2B with 162% YoY growth are correctly cited from Chunk 4. However, there are minor issues: (1) The answer states 'Q4 2025' and 'Q3 2025' but the context shows these are fiscal year periods - Chunk 1 appears to be Q4 FY2025 based on the $39,331M revenue matching the January 26, 2025 data in Chunk 8. (2) The QoQ growth percentages (+12%, +17%, +16%) for revenue are not explicitly stated in the chunks - they would need to be calculated. (3) The 'down 160 bps QoQ' for gross margin is a calculation (74.6% - 73% = 1.6 percentage points) rather than directly stated. The answer correctly notes that forward guidance was not found in provided sources, though Chunk 7 does contain Q4 guidance of $65B for FY2026. Overall, the answer demonstrates good faithfulness with minor calculation-based additions."

      "score": 0.7,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer partially addresses the ground truth's key points. It correctly conveys that Nvidia has strong AI infrastructure demand driving growth, particularly in data center revenue (93% YoY growth mentioned). The answer also captures management's optimistic outlook with Blackwell demand being 'off the charts' and visibility to $0.5T in future revenue, which aligns with the 'optimistic guidance' mentioned in the ground truth. However, the generated answer explicitly states 'Forward guidance: Not found in provided sources' which contradicts the ground truth's claim about 'optimistic guidance.' While the answer does include forward-looking statements about Blackwell/Rubin revenue visibility, it doesn't explicitly confirm the 'sustained growth in data center revenue' expectation as formal guidance. The answer provides much more detail than the ground truth but is somewhat inconsistent on the specific point about forward guidance."
