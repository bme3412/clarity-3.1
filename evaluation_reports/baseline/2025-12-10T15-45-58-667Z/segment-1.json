  "question": "How is Amazon's AWS performing compared to overall company growth?",
  "ground_truth": "AWS continues to be a key profit driver for Amazon, with growth rates driven by cloud adoption and AI services, though facing competitive pressure from Azure and Google Cloud.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n• AWS revenue: $27.5B in Q1 2025, 18% YoY growth [C1]\n• AWS operating income: $11.5B in Q1 2025, 23% YoY growth [C1] \n• AWS operating margin: 39.5% in Q1 2025 vs 37.6% in Q1 2024 [C1]\n• AWS TTM operating income: $42.0B, 45% YoY growth [C1]\n• AWS TTM operating margin: 37.5% [C1]\n• AWS Q4 2024 revenue: $28.8B, 19% YoY growth [C2]\n• AWS Q4 2024 operating income: $10.6B, 48% YoY growth [C2]\n• AWS Q4 2024 operating margin: 36.9% [C2]\n• AWS described as \"clear cloud infrastructure leader\" with investments in generative AI and large language models [C5]\n Final Answer:\nAWS revenue: $27.5B (YoY +18% / QoQ -4%) [C1]\nAWS operating income: $11.5B (YoY +23% / QoQ +9%) [C1]\nAWS operating margin: 39.5% (+190 bps YoY / +260 bps QoQ) [C1]\nAWS demonstrates strong profitability expansion with TTM operating income of $42.0B (+45% YoY) and TTM operating margin reaching 37.5% [C1]. The segment maintains its position as the \"clear cloud infrastructure leader\" with significant investments in generative AI and large language models [C5]. Sequential revenue declined from Q4 2024's $28.8B to Q1 2025's $27.5B, typical seasonal pattern, while margins continued expanding to nearly 40% [C1][C2].",

      "score": 0.35,
      "reasoning": "The answer provides extensive detail about AWS's performance metrics (revenue, operating income, margins) but fails to adequately address the core question about how AWS compares to OVERALL company growth. The question asks for a comparison between AWS and Amazon's total company performance, but the answer only presents AWS-specific data without providing Amazon's overall revenue growth, operating income growth, or any direct comparison metrics. To properly answer this question, the response should have included Amazon's total company growth figures alongside AWS figures to enable comparison."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.3,
      "reasoning": "The answer contains significant hallucinations and misattributes data from the context. The context shows Q1 2025 AWS revenue as $29,267M (not $27.5B) with 17% YoY growth (not 18%). The Q1 2025 operating income of $11,547M and 39.5% margin are from Chunk 6, but the answer incorrectly cites these as [C1]. The context does not contain Q1 2025 data in Chunk 1 - Chunk 1 discusses partnerships and goals, not financial metrics. The TTM figures cited ($42.0B, 45%, 37.5%) appear to be from Chunk 6 but are misattributed. The answer also fabricates QoQ percentage changes that are not explicitly stated in the context. While some figures like the 39.5% margin and 'clear cloud infrastructure leader' description are present in the context, the systematic misattribution of sources and incorrect revenue/growth figures represent substantial unfaithfulness to the provided context."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.7,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer provides detailed, specific financial data about AWS performance (revenue, operating income, margins) with citations, which is factually rich and demonstrates AWS's profitability. This aligns with the ground truth's assertion that 'AWS continues to be a key profit driver for Amazon.' The generated answer also mentions AWS as the 'clear cloud infrastructure leader' with AI investments, which partially addresses the ground truth's mention of 'AI services.' However, the generated answer does not address two key elements from the ground truth: (1) growth driven by 'cloud adoption' as a broader trend, and (2) 'competitive pressure from Azure and Google Cloud.' The omission of competitive dynamics is a notable gap. The answer is consistent with the ground truth but incomplete in covering all aspects mentioned."
