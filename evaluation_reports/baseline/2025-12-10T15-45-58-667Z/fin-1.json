  "question": "What was AMD's total revenue in Q3 2024?",
  "ground_truth": "AMD's total revenue in Q3 2024 was $6.8 billion, representing an 18% increase year-over-year.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n• Q3 2024 revenue: $6,819 million [C1]\n• Revenue growth: 17.6% [C1]\n• Gross margin: 50% [C1]\n• Operating margin: 10.6% [C1]\n• Net income: $771 million [C1]\n• EPS diluted: $0.47 [C1]\n Final Answer:\nRevenue: $6.82B (YoY +17.6%) [C1]\nGross margin: 50.0% [C1]\nOperating margin: 10.6% [C1]\nNet income reached $771M with diluted EPS of $0.47 [C1]. Quarter-over-quarter growth rates not found in provided sources.",
  "duration_ms": 11294,
  "metrics": {
    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The answer directly addresses the question about AMD's total revenue in Q3 2024, providing the specific figure of $6,819 million (or $6.82B). The answer goes beyond the basic question by also providing additional relevant financial context like growth rate, margins, and net income. The response is well-cited and accurate to the question asked."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the provided context. The revenue ($6,819M/~$6.82B), revenue growth (17.6%), gross margin (50%), operating margin (10.6%), net income ($771M), and diluted EPS ($0.47) are all correctly cited from Chunk 1. However, there are two minor issues: 1) The answer states 'YoY +17.6%' but the context only shows 'revenue_growth: 17.6' without specifying it's year-over-year (though this is a reasonable inference). 2) The context in Chunk 4 mentions Q3 gross margin was 53.6%, which contradicts the 50% figure from Chunk 1 - the answer chose to use the 50% from Chunk 1 without acknowledging this discrepancy. The answer appropriately notes that quarter-over-quarter growth rates were not found in the sources, which is accurate."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.9,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer provides the revenue figure as $6,819 million ($6.82B), which matches the ground truth of $6.8 billion. The year-over-year growth is stated as 17.6% in the generated answer versus 18% in the ground truth - this is a minor discrepancy that could be due to rounding (17.6% rounds to 18%). The generated answer actually provides more detail than the ground truth (gross margin, operating margin, net income, EPS), which is consistent with the scoring criteria. The slight difference in the percentage (17.6% vs 18%) prevents a perfect score, but the core facts are essentially accurate."
