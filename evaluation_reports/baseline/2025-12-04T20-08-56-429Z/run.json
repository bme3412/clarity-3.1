SUPPORTED: The quarterly revenue figures for Data Center (Q4: $35.6B, Q3: $30.77B, Q2: $26.27B) are accurate per the context. The YoY growth rates (Q3: 94% shown as 112% in context for data center specifically, Q2: 122% shown as 154% in context) appear to be using total revenue YoY growth rather than data center specific growth - this is a misrepresentation. The total revenue figures cited are accurate. Free cash flow figures are partially supported ($15.5B for Q4 is close to $15.519B in context). PROBLEMATIC: 1) The YoY growth percentages in the table don't match the context - Q4 shows 78% but context shows 93% YoY for data center; Q3 shows 94% but context shows 112%; Q2 shows 122% but context shows 154%. 2) The 'Q2 FY2026' and 'Q3 FY2026' references appear to be errors as the context only covers FY2025 quarters. 3) The strategic context about 'AI/ML training', 'Blackwell architecture ramp', and 'enterprise and cloud service provider adoption' are reasonable inferences but not explicitly stated in the provided context. 4) The analyst questions mention Blackwell but don't provide the strategic details claimed."

          "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the provided context, but contains some elements that require scrutiny. The Data Center revenue figures for Q3 2025 ($4.34B, +22.3% YoY), Q2 2025 ($3.24B, +14.3% YoY), and Q1 2025 ($3.67B, +57.2% YoY) are accurately derived from chunks 6, 7, and 8 respectively. The Q2 2024 ($5.8B) and Q3 2024 ($6.8B) total revenue figures match chunks 1 and 3. The MI300/MI325/MI350 product roadmap information aligns with chunk 4. The mention of MI450 reaching scale with OCI and DOE comes from chunk 5. The 'great progress across the board' quote is supported by chunk 2. However, the answer states 'strong double-digit sequential Data Center growth guidance for Q4 2025' which appears to be an interpretation/extrapolation from chunk 5's mention of 'Q4 strong double digit guidance' - the context doesn't explicitly confirm this is for Q4 2025 specifically. The statement about 'Server slightly outperforming directionally' in Q3 2025 is supported by chunk 5. Minor deduction for the slight ambiguity around the Q4 guidance timing and some synthesized conclusions that go slightly beyond explicit context statements."

It confirms strong AI demand, specifically mentions MI300 accelerators as a key revenue driver, and outlines AMD's expanded AI product portfolio (MI300, MI325, MI350, MI450 roadmap). The ground truth mentions Lisa Su emphasized these points, while the generated answer doesn't attribute to her specifically but covers the same substantive content about AI demand strength and product expansion plans. The answer is factually aligned and provides concrete revenue figures and growth percentages that support the ground truth's claims. Minor deduction because the ground truth specifically mentions CEO Lisa Su's emphasis, which the generated answer doesn't explicitly reference."

The revenue figures and growth percentages in the table accurately reflect the data from the chunks (FY2026 Q3: $57.0B/+62%/+22%, FY2026 Q2: $46.7B/+56%/+6%, FY2025 Q4: $39.3B/+78%/+12%, FY2025 Q3: $35.1B/+94%/+17%, FY2025 Q2: $30.0B/+122%/+15%). The segment performance data for FY2025 Q4 showing Data Center at $35.6B and Gaming at $2.5B is correctly extracted from Chunk 6. The reference to analyst questions about $500B AI infrastructure and $/GW assumptions is supported by Chunk 1. The answer appropriately notes that specific forward guidance was not found in the context. However, there are minor issues: the answer states revenue 'nearly doubled from $30B to $57B over five quarters' which is a reasonable inference but involves some calculation not explicitly stated in the context. The claim about 'YoY growth rates remain strong at 56-62%' slightly oversimplifies as the range shown is actually 56-122%. Overall, the answer stays close to the source material with only minor interpretive additions."

However, the generated answer explicitly states that 'specific forward guidance numbers... were not found in the retrieved context' and that it 'does not include explicit management guidance figures.' This contradicts the ground truth's claim about 'optimistic guidance' and 'expecting sustained growth.' The generated answer provides extensive historical data showing strong growth, which supports the general narrative, but it fails to confirm the specific claim about forward-looking optimistic guidance that the ground truth asserts. The answer is factually accurate about what it presents but incomplete regarding the guidance aspect."
