      "score": 0.8,
      "reasoning": "The answer is relevant to the question as it directly addresses whether the requested information (Meta's Reality Labs operating loss in Q1 2017) is available. The response correctly acknowledges that the specific data requested is not found in the provided sources and explains what data is available instead. While it doesn't provide the actual answer to the question (because the data isn't available), it appropriately responds to the query by being transparent about the limitation. This is a relevant and appropriate response to an unanswerable question given the available context."

    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer is completely faithful to the provided context. The response correctly states that no Reality Labs operating loss data for Q1 2017 was found in the sources, which is accurate - the context only contains information about 2025 Q3 Reality Labs revenue ($0.47B, +74% YoY) and mentions AI glasses. The answer appropriately cites the available information [C2] while clearly indicating that the requested Q1 2017 data is not present. There are no hallucinations or fabricated information."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the information was not found in the provided sources, which matches the ground truth. The generated answer provides additional context about what data IS available (2025 Q3 Reality Labs revenue), but this extra detail is consistent with the ground truth's conclusion that the specific requested information (Q1 2017 Reality Labs operating loss) was not found. The core factual determination is identical."
