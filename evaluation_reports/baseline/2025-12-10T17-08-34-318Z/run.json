The statements about Data Center representing more than 50% of revenue mix and Q4 gross margin guidance of approximately 54% are accurately cited from Chunk 4. The answer appropriately notes that QoQ growth rates were not found in the sources. The only minor issue is the revenue being presented as $6.82B when the source shows $6,819 (which could be interpreted as millions, making it $6.819B), but this is a reasonable rounding.

The year-over-year growth is stated as 17.6% in the generated answer versus 18% in the ground truth - this is a minor discrepancy that could be due to rounding (17.6% rounds to 18%). The generated answer actually provides significantly more detail than the ground truth (gross margin, operating income, net income, EPS, etc.) and is consistent with the core facts. The slight difference in the percentage (17.6% vs 18%) is the only minor deviation, which appears to be a rounding difference rather than a factual error."

However, the answer states AMD raised guidance 'by $500M' which is an inference (from $4.5B to $5B) rather than explicitly stated in the context - the context says 'raised overall guidance' but doesn't quantify the increase as '$500M'.

While the components roughly add up to the total, the answer fails to explicitly state the record $3.5 billion figure and the critical 122% year-over-year growth metric mentioned in the ground truth.

The answer also includes context about growth drivers like Blackwell.

The fiscal 2025 total of $115.2B and Blackwell $11B revenue are correctly cited from chunk 12. The Q2 2026 figures ($41.1B, 17% sequential Blackwell growth) are correctly from chunk 4. However, there are some issues: (1) The citation references [C1], [C2], etc. don't perfectly align with the chunk numbering in the context - the financial data chunks are numbered 1-3 but the answer cites them as if they correspond to different quarters than what the chunks actually represent. (2) The 'Hopper 200' reference appears to be a slight misquote - chunk 12 mentions 'Hopper 200 continued sequential growth' which the answer captures.

The generated answer confirms this with specific figures: YoY growth of +154% (Q2 2025), +112% (Q3 2025), and +93% (Q4 2025), which are indeed triple-digit or near-triple-digit growth rates. The answer also confirms the 'more than doubling' of fiscal 2025 revenue ($115.2B) and attributes growth to AI GPU demand (Hopper, Blackwell platforms). The generated answer provides precise quarterly figures, product-specific details, and extends into Q2 2026, all of which are consistent with and expand upon the ground truth's claims about significant AI-driven data center revenue growth."

The only actual guidance mentioned is the Q4 2024 guidance of $20B which is outdated.
