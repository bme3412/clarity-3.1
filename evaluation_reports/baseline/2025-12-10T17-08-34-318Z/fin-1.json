  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n• Q3 2024 revenue: $6,819 million [C1]\n• Revenue growth: 17.6% [C1]\n• Gross profit: $3,419 million [C1]\n• Gross margin: 50% [C1]\n• Operating income: $724 million [C1]\n• Operating margin: 10.6% [C1]\n• Net income: $771 million [C1]\n• EPS diluted: $0.47 [C1]\n• Data Center business accounts for more than 50% of revenue mix [C4]\n• Q4 2024 gross margin guidance: approximately 54% [C4]\n Final Answer:\nRevenue: $6.82B (YoY +17.6%)[C1]\nGross margin: 50.0%[C1]  \nOperating margin: 10.6%[C1]  \nNet margin: 11.3%[C1]\nOperating income: $724M[C1]  \nNet income: $771M[C1]  \nEPS (diluted): $0.47[C1]\nData Center business now represents more than 50% of AMD's revenue mix, serving as the primary driver of gross margin improvement [C4].

      "reasoning": "The answer directly and completely addresses the question about AMD's total revenue in Q3 2024. It clearly states the revenue was $6,819 million (or $6.82B) with a 17.6% year-over-year growth. The answer goes beyond the basic question by providing additional relevant financial metrics like gross margin, operating income, net income, and EPS, which adds context and value to the response."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The answer is highly faithful to the provided context. All financial metrics (revenue $6,819M, gross margin 50%, operating margin 10.6%, net margin 11.3%, operating income $724M, net income $771M, EPS diluted $0.47, revenue growth 17.6%) are directly sourced from Chunk 1. The statements about Data Center representing more than 50% of revenue mix and Q4 gross margin guidance of approximately 54% are accurately cited from Chunk 4. The answer appropriately notes that QoQ growth rates were not found in the sources. The only minor issue is the revenue being presented as $6.82B when the source shows $6,819 (which could be interpreted as millions, making it $6.819B), but this is a reasonable rounding. All claims are properly attributed to their source chunks."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.9,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer provides AMD's Q3 2024 revenue as $6,819 million ($6.82B), which matches the ground truth of $6.8 billion. The year-over-year growth is stated as 17.6% in the generated answer versus 18% in the ground truth - this is a minor discrepancy that could be due to rounding (17.6% rounds to 18%). The generated answer actually provides significantly more detail than the ground truth (gross margin, operating income, net income, EPS, etc.) and is consistent with the core facts. The slight difference in the percentage (17.6% vs 18%) is the only minor deviation, which appears to be a rounding difference rather than a factual error."

So, you know, let me start with your original question. I mean, I think looking at 325X, we are on track to launch later this year. From a revenue standpoint, there will be a small contribution in the fourth quarter, but it really is still mostly the MI300 capabilities.\\n\\nAnd 325 will start in the fourth quarter and then ramp more in the first half of next year. And then as we look at the 350 Series, what we're seeing and the reason we call it a series is because there will be multiple SKUs in that series that we'll go through the range of, let's call it, air-cooled to liquid-cooled.
