    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.7,
      "reasoning": "The answer is relevant to the question as it directly addresses the query about Apple's FY2018 gross margin. While it doesn't provide the actual gross margin figure, it appropriately explains that the information is not available in the provided sources and clarifies what data is actually available (2025 Q4 data). This is a valid and helpful response given the context limitations, though it doesn't fully answer the question with the requested data."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer is completely faithful to the provided context. The generated answer correctly states that FY2018 gross margin data is not found in the provided sources, and accurately notes that the context only contains 2025 Q4 information. This is true - the provided chunks only contain Q4 FY2025 data and analyst questions, with no mention of FY2018 or gross margin figures. The answer does not hallucinate any information and appropriately acknowledges the limitation of the available context."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the FY2018 gross margin data is not found in the provided sources, which matches the ground truth. The generated answer provides additional context explaining why (the sources only contain 2025 Q4 information), but this extra detail is consistent with and supports the ground truth answer. The key fact - that the information is not available in the provided sources - is accurately conveyed."
