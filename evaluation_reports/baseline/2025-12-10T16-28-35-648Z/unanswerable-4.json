      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is relevant to the question as it directly addresses the query about Meta's Reality Labs operating loss in Q1 2017. The response appropriately indicates that the information was not found in the provided sources and explains what data is available (2025 Q3 data). This is a valid and helpful response when the requested information is not available in the source documents. The answer doesn't fabricate data and transparently communicates the limitation."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The answer is highly faithful to the provided context. The response correctly identifies that Q1 2017 data is not present in the sources and accurately cites the Reality Labs data that IS available (revenue of $0.47B with +74% YoY change from Chunk 2). The answer appropriately states 'Not found in provided sources' rather than hallucinating information about 2017. The only minor issue is the reference to '2025 Q3' which is not explicitly stated in the context - the context doesn't specify the exact time period. However, the core claim about the available data is accurate, and the answer avoids fabricating any information not present in the context."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the information is not found in the provided sources, which matches the ground truth. The generated answer provides additional context about what data IS available (Reality Labs Q3 2025 data), which is helpful and does not contradict the ground truth. The core factual claim - that Q1 2017 Reality Labs data is not available - is accurate and consistent with the ground truth."
