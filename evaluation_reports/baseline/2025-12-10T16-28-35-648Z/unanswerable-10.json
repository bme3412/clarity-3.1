      "reasoning": "The answer is relevant to the question in that it directly addresses the query about Slack revenue in Q3 2018. It correctly acknowledges that the information was not found in the provided sources and explains why (the sources contained Q2 2026 data instead). While the answer doesn't provide the actual revenue figure requested, it appropriately responds to the question by indicating the data is unavailable in the given context. The score is not higher because the answer doesn't attempt to provide the actual information or suggest where it might be found."

      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer is completely faithful to the provided context. The context only contains information about Salesforce Q2 FY26 financials and analyst questions - there is no information about Slack revenue or Q3 2018 data. The generated answer correctly identifies that the requested information is 'Not found in provided sources' and accurately notes that the context contains Salesforce Q2 2026 data rather than the requested Q3 2018 Slack information. The answer does not hallucinate or fabricate any information."

    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the information is not found in the provided sources, which matches the ground truth. The generated answer provides additional context explaining why the information wasn't found (the sources contain Q2 2026 Salesforce data rather than Q3 2018 Slack data), but this additional detail is consistent with and supports the ground truth answer."
