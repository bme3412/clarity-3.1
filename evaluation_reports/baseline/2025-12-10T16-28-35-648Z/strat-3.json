  "question": "How is Meta investing in AI infrastructure?",
  "ground_truth": "Meta is investing heavily in AI infrastructure, including building large GPU clusters, developing custom AI chips, and expanding data center capacity to support AI model training and inference.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n• 2025 Q3 guidance includes higher infrastructure and compensation costs with faster expense and CapEx growth [C1]\n• Exploring data-center financing partnerships to manage multi-gigawatt build [C2]\n• Q3 2025 revenue guidance $47.5-50.5B, CapEx guidance $66-72B (narrowed, ~$30B YoY increase) [C2]\n• 2026 CapEx and expenses expected to keep growing with infrastructure and talent investments [C2]\n• Primary capital allocation focus remains investing in infrastructure and talent as top priorities [C4]\n• Infrastructure teams executing well, building significant capacity to support Meta AI and future AI-driven products [C7]\n• AI is transforming five areas: ads, engagement, business messaging, Meta AI, and AI devices with investments in each [C3]\n Final Answer:\nMeta is significantly scaling AI infrastructure investments with CapEx guidance of $66-72B for 2025, representing approximately $30B year-over-year increase [C2]. The company prioritizes infrastructure and talent as top capital allocation focuses [C4], with 2026 expected to bring continued CapEx and expense growth for infrastructure expansion [C2].\nTo manage the massive scale requirements, Meta is exploring data-center financing partnerships for multi-gigawatt builds [C2]. Infrastructure teams are executing well, building significant capacity to support Meta AI and future AI-driven products effectively [C7].\nThe AI investment strategy spans five key areas: advertising, engagement, business messaging, Meta AI, and AI devices, with investments flowing into each downstream of their general intelligence capabilities [C3]. This comprehensive approach reflects Meta's commitment to AI infrastructure as foundational to their product ecosystem, with accelerating investment pace planned through 2026 [C1].",

      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The answer directly and comprehensively addresses the question about Meta's AI infrastructure investments. It provides specific details including: CapEx guidance figures ($66-72B for 2025), year-over-year increase (~$30B), data-center financing partnerships, infrastructure team execution, and the five key areas of AI investment. The answer is well-structured with citations and covers both current investments and future plans through 2026. The only minor deduction is for some slight redundancy in the presentation, but overall it's highly relevant and thorough."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the provided context, with most claims properly supported by the chunks. However, there are some issues: 1) The citation [C1] in the answer refers to '2025 Q3 guidance' but Chunk 1 is about Q1 2025 results, not Q3 guidance - the Q3 guidance information is actually in Chunk 4. 2) The citation numbering in the answer doesn't match the chunk numbering provided (e.g., [C2] claims come from Chunk 4, [C4] claims come from Chunk 5, [C7] claims come from Chunk 7). 3) The core factual claims about CapEx ($66-72B), data-center financing partnerships, infrastructure priorities, and the five AI areas are all present in the context. 4) The claim about 'multi-gigawatt build' is supported by Chunk 4. 5) The five AI areas (ads, engagement, business messaging, Meta AI, AI devices) are correctly stated from Chunk 1. The answer doesn't contain hallucinations of facts not in the context, but the citation mapping is inconsistent with the actual chunk numbers provided."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer is consistent with the ground truth's core claim that Meta is investing heavily in AI infrastructure. It provides substantial supporting evidence including specific CapEx figures ($66-72B for 2025, ~$30B YoY increase), mentions data center expansion (multi-gigawatt builds, financing partnerships), and discusses infrastructure capacity building. However, the generated answer does not explicitly mention 'GPU clusters' or 'custom AI chips' which are specific elements in the ground truth. The generated answer provides more detail about the investment areas (ads, engagement, messaging, Meta AI, AI devices) and financial specifics, which is consistent but doesn't directly address the hardware-level details (GPUs, custom chips) mentioned in the ground truth. The answer is factually aligned but misses some specific technical infrastructure components."
