The company's primary capital allocation focus centers on infrastructure and talent as top priorities [C4]. Meta is building significant AI infrastructure capacity to support growing demands of Meta AI and future AI-driven products [C7].\nThe scale of investment is considerable, with 2025 CapEx guidance of $66-72B representing approximately $30B year-over-year increase [C2]. These investments will continue growing, as 2026 CapEx and expenses are expected to keep expanding with infrastructure and talent [C2]. To manage the massive scale, Meta is exploring data-center financing partnerships for multi-gigawatt builds [C2].\nOn the talent side, Meta added roughly 2,800 employees in Q1 2025, with the significant majority in technical roles supporting monetization and infrastructure priorities [C4]. The infrastructure investments support AI transformation across five key areas: ads, engagement, business messaging, Meta AI, and AI devices, with each investment downstream of general intelligence and infrastructure builds [C3].\nWhile infrastructure ROI is strong for ads and ranking applications, GenAI monetization is expected to lag [C2], indicating Meta's long-term investment horizon for AI infrastructure returns.",

      "reasoning": "The answer directly and comprehensively addresses the question about how Meta is investing in AI infrastructure. It covers multiple dimensions of Meta's AI infrastructure investments including: capital expenditure figures ($66-72B for 2025), data center financing partnerships, talent acquisition (2,800 employees in Q1 2025), the strategic focus areas (ads, engagement, business messaging, Meta AI, AI devices), and the expected ROI timeline. The answer is well-organized with specific citations and provides both quantitative data and strategic context about Meta's AI infrastructure investments."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the provided context, with most claims properly supported by the chunks. However, there are some minor issues: 1) The citation [C4] for capital allocation focus actually corresponds to Chunk 5 in the context, not Chunk 4 - the content matches but citation numbering appears inconsistent with how chunks are labeled. 2) The claim about 'multi-gigawatt build' from [C2] is actually found in Chunk 3, not Chunk 2. 3) The CapEx figures of $66-72B are mentioned in Chunk 3, and the $64-72B figure appears in Chunk 1 - there's a slight discrepancy in the exact range cited. 4) The statement about 2,800 employees is correctly sourced from Chunk 5. 5) The five AI areas (ads, engagement, business messaging, Meta AI, AI devices) are correctly attributed to Mark Zuckerberg's comments in Chunk 1. Overall, the substantive information is present in the context, but there are citation mapping inconsistencies that suggest the answer may have some organizational issues in how it references sources."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer is fully consistent with the ground truth and provides significantly more detail. The ground truth states Meta is investing heavily in AI infrastructure including GPU clusters, custom AI chips, and data center capacity. The generated answer confirms this with specific details: $66-72B CapEx guidance for 2025 (a $30B YoY increase), building significant AI infrastructure capacity, exploring data-center financing partnerships for multi-gigawatt builds, and hiring technical talent for infrastructure priorities. While the generated answer doesn't explicitly mention 'GPU clusters' or 'custom AI chips' by name, it comprehensively covers the broader AI infrastructure investment theme with concrete financial figures and strategic details that align with and expand upon the ground truth."

Next, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. Our primary focus remains investing capital back into the business with infrastructure and talent being our top priorities. Starting with headcount, our hiring continues to be targeted at technical roles within our company priorities. In the first quarter, the significant majority of the roughly 2,800 employees we added were to support our priorities of monetization, infrastructure, generative AI, regulation and compliance and Reality Labs. On infrastructure, we have 2 primary focuses to meet the growing compute needs of our services and AI initiatives."
