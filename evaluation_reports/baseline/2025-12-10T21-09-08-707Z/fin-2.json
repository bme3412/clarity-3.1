  "question": "How did the AMD Data Center segment perform in Q3 2024?",
  "ground_truth": "The Data Center segment revenue reached a record $3.5 billion in Q3 2024, up 122% year-over-year, driven by strong sales of AMD Instinct GPUs and EPYC CPUs.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n• AMD Data Center segment had a very strong Q3 2024 quarter overall, especially for the Instinct product portfolio [C2][C5]\n• Data Center GPU revenue was approaching the size of AMD's compute business, which was around $1.7 billion [C6]\n• September actuals for Data Center GPU were in the $1.5 billion range [C4]\n• AMD completed important customer milestones and ramped above initial expectations in Q3 [C5]\n• AMD raised full-year Data Center GPU guidance from exceeding $4.5 billion to exceeding $5 billion [C5]\n• The guidance increase was based on completion of customer milestones [C5]\n Final Answer:\nAMD's Data Center segment delivered very strong performance in Q3 2024, particularly driven by the Instinct GPU portfolio [C2][C5]. Data Center GPU revenue approached approximately $1.5 billion, nearing the size of AMD's compute business which was around $1.7 billion [C4][C6].\nThe segment exceeded initial expectations as AMD completed important customer milestones and ramped production above original plans [C5]. This strong performance led AMD to raise its full-year Data Center GPU guidance by $500 million, from exceeding $4.5 billion to exceeding $5 billion [C5].\nThe guidance increase was specifically attributed to the successful completion of customer milestones during the quarter [C5]. AMD expressed confidence in the trajectory through the end of 2024 based on this momentum [C5].\nSpecific quarterly revenue growth rates, margins, and detailed segment breakdowns were not found in provided sources.",

    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the question about AMD's Data Center segment performance in Q3 2024. It provides specific details including revenue figures (~$1.5 billion for Data Center GPU), comparison to compute business ($1.7 billion), raised guidance (from $4.5B to $5B), and qualitative performance indicators (strong quarter, exceeded expectations, completed customer milestones). The answer includes citations and acknowledges limitations where specific data wasn't available. The response comprehensively covers the segment's Q3 2024 performance."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The answer is highly faithful to the provided context. All key claims are properly supported: (1) Strong Q3 2024 Data Center performance, especially Instinct portfolio - directly from C2/C5; (2) Data Center GPU revenue approaching $1.5 billion and compute business around $1.7 billion - from C4/C6; (3) Exceeded initial expectations and completed customer milestones - from C5; (4) Guidance raised from $4.5B to $5B - from C5; (5) Guidance increase attributed to customer milestones - from C5. The answer appropriately notes that specific quarterly growth rates, margins, and detailed breakdowns were not found in sources. The only minor issue is that C4 mentions '$1.5 billion range' as an analyst's estimate/question rather than a confirmed figure, but the answer presents it as factual. This is a slight overstatement but the information is still derived from the context."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.2,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer fails to provide the key facts from the ground truth. The ground truth states Data Center segment revenue was $3.5 billion (a record), up 122% year-over-year. The generated answer instead focuses on Data Center GPU revenue being approximately $1.5 billion and discusses guidance increases, but never mentions the total segment revenue of $3.5 billion or the 122% YoY growth. The answer also doesn't mention EPYC CPUs as a driver. While some information about strong performance and Instinct GPUs is consistent, the core quantitative facts (total revenue figure and growth rate) are missing, and the generated answer even admits 'Specific quarterly revenue growth rates... were not found.' This is a significant factual gap."
