      "reasoning": "The answer is relevant to the question as it directly addresses the query about Apple's FY2018 gross margin. While it doesn't provide the actual gross margin figure, it appropriately explains that the information is not available in the provided source materials and clarifies what data is actually contained in the sources (Q4 FY2025 data). This is a valid and helpful response when the requested information is not in the available context, rather than hallucinating an answer."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer is completely faithful to the provided context. The generated answer correctly states that FY2018 gross margin data is not found in the provided sources, which is accurate - the context only contains Q4 FY2025 data (total revenue of $102.5 billion) and analyst questions from that period. The answer does not hallucinate any FY2018 figures and appropriately acknowledges the limitation of the available context. This demonstrates proper faithfulness by not fabricating information that isn't present in the source materials."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the FY2018 gross margin data is not found in the provided sources, which matches the ground truth. The generated answer provides additional context explaining why the information is not available (the sources only contain Q4 FY2025 data), but this additional detail is consistent with and supports the ground truth answer."
