The $500 million guidance increase is mentioned in Chunk 4. Gross margin of 53.6% in Q3 and ~54% Q4 guidance is confirmed in Chunk 3. The MI325X timing (small Q4 contribution, ramping in H1 2025) is confirmed in Chunks 10 and 12. The PC market being 'a good revenue growth opportunity' is confirmed in Chunk 6. The financial figures ($724M operating income, 10.6% margin, $628M operating cash flow, $771M net income, $0.47 diluted EPS) are confirmed in Chunk 13. However, the answer includes some minor extrapolations not explicitly stated in context, such as characterizing Embedded recovery as 'modest at best' (context only mentions 'muted recovery' from analyst question in Chunk 7) and the Q4 outlook statement about 'continued Data Center strength offsetting still-soft Embedded trends' which is reasonable inference but not directly stated."

The generated answer confirms this by providing specific quarterly figures showing triple-digit YoY growth rates during FY2025 (112% YoY in Q3 FY2025, 93% YoY in Q4 FY2025). The answer also accurately notes that growth rates moderated to 50-60% in FY2026 due to base effects, which is consistent with the ground truth's timeframe of FY2024-2025 for triple-digit growth.

The information about 2024 Q4 results ($48.4B revenue, 48% margin, Meta AI scaling toward 1B users, Llama 4 capabilities) is accurately derived from the context. The 2025 information about Meta AI having ~1B monthly actives, the standalone app, AI recommendation improvements (5% Instagram, 3% Facebook conversions), and the data-center financing partnerships are all present in the context. However, there are some concerns: 1) The CapEx guidance of $66-72B is mentioned in the context for Q2 2025, but the answer states it as 'roughly $30B higher than 2024' - while this comparison appears in the context, the exact 2024 baseline isn't clearly stated. 2) The statement about 2022 having 'no retrieved evidence' is accurate. 3) The 2023 depreciation figures ($11.2B vs $15.5B) appear to be derived from the cash flow statement in Chunk 10, which shows 2023 depreciation of $11,178M and 2024 of $15,498M - this is accurate. 4) The claim that capex 'roughly tripled' from 2022-2025 is not directly supported by the context. 5) The Q1 FY2025 CapEx guidance was actually stated as $64-72B in Chunk 1, not $66-72B.

          "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the provided context but contains some elements that go beyond what's explicitly stated. Faithful elements include: the MI300 progress quote from Lisa Su, the Q2 2024 revenue of $5.8B and Q3 2024 revenue of $6.8B with growth figures, the MI325/350 product roadmap details, the Q3 FY2025 revenue of $9.2B with 35.6% growth and 52% gross margin, the MI450 mention with OCI and DOE, and Jean Hu's comments about Server/GPU growth. However, the answer makes several claims not directly supported by the context: 1) The characterization of 2024 as an 'inflection point' is interpretive rather than stated, 2) The claim about 'single-customer concentration toward diversified hyperscaler adoption' is not in the context, 3) The statement about 'infrastructure partners committing to multi-generational roadmaps' is not explicitly supported, 4) Some framing around 2022-2023 acknowledges lack of evidence but still makes inferences. The core financial data and direct quotes are accurate, but the narrative synthesis adds interpretive elements."

          "reasoning": "The generated answer is consistent with the ground truth and significantly expands upon it. It confirms strong AI demand (mentioning MI300 accelerators moving to production scale, revenue growth) and outlines AMD's expanding AI product portfolio (MI325, MI350, MI450 roadmap). The answer correctly attributes statements to Lisa Su and provides specific details about market opportunity capture through hyperscaler and enterprise adoption. However, the ground truth specifically mentions Lisa Su 'emphasized' these points, suggesting a more direct attribution to her statements, while the generated answer distributes commentary across multiple executives (including Jean Hu). The core facts align well, but the generated answer is more of a comprehensive timeline analysis rather than a direct summary of Lisa Su's emphasis, which slightly diverges from the ground truth's framing."

          "reasoning": "The answer directly and comprehensively addresses the question about Nvidia's revenue guidance for upcoming quarters. It provides specific Q4 FY2026 guidance (~$45B), discusses the longer-term revenue visibility ($0.5T pipeline), shows recent quarterly trajectory for context, and includes margin expectations. The answer is highly relevant, detailed, and well-organized with supporting information about product roadmap and growth drivers that contextualize the guidance figures."

        "faithfulness": {
          "score": 0.35,
          "reasoning": "The answer contains significant hallucinations. The context explicitly states Q4 FY2026 guidance is '$65.0 ±2% billion USD' (from Chunk 4), not '$45B' as claimed in the answer. The answer correctly cites the $0.5T Blackwell/Rubin visibility, the Q3 FY2026 revenue of $57.0B, and the GB300 crossing over GB200 from the context. However, the Q4 guidance figure is a critical factual error. The Q2 revenue of $46.7B and Q1 revenue of $44.1B are supported by the context. The claim about '1,000 racks per week' for GB300 is in the context (Chunk 3). The margin guidance of 'mid-70s' and specific Q4 margin guidance of '~74.8/75%' is in the context, but the answer's characterization is somewhat imprecise. The major issue is the completely incorrect Q4 revenue guidance figure, which is a fundamental factual error that significantly undermines the faithfulness of the response."

          "reasoning": "The generated answer is fully consistent with the ground truth and provides substantially more detail. The ground truth states that Nvidia provided optimistic guidance driven by continued AI infrastructure demand with expected sustained growth in data center revenue. The generated answer confirms this with specific details: Q4 FY2026 guidance of ~$45B, a $0.5T forward pipeline in Blackwell/Rubin revenue tied to AI infrastructure spending, remarkable revenue growth trajectory (Q3 at $57B, +62% YoY), Data Center revenue reaching ~$50B in Q3, and sustained momentum driven by Blackwell architecture demand. All key facts align with the ground truth's assertion of optimistic guidance and AI infrastructure-driven data center growth expectations."
