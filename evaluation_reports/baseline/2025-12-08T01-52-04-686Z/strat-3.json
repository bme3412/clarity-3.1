  "question": "How is Meta investing in AI infrastructure?",
  "ground_truth": "Meta is investing heavily in AI infrastructure, including building large GPU clusters, developing custom AI chips, and expanding data center capacity to support AI model training and inference.",
  "generated_answer": "Meta's AI infrastructure and investment trajectory shows a dramatic acceleration from 2022 through 2025, with capital expenditure roughly tripling and AI becoming the organizing principle for nearly every product and resource allocation decision.\n2022\nNo retrieved evidence available for this year in the provided context.\n2023\nLimited direct context, though Q4 2024 year-over-year comparisons indicate 2023 served as the baseline before the major AI capex surge. Depreciation and amortization was $11.2B for full-year 2023 versus $15.5B in 2024, reflecting the infrastructure ramp that followed.\n2024\nThe inflection year for AI monetization and infrastructure commitment. Q4 FY2024 delivered total revenue of $48.4B (+21% YoY) with operating margins at 48%, while AI recommendation models began demonstrably improving ad performance. Mark Zuckerberg positioned the year around scaling Meta AI \"toward one billion people, with a focus on highly personalized experiences and multimodal agents, while Llama 4 prepares to deliver agentic capabilities\" [Q4 FY2024]. On infrastructure: \"we continue ramping AI coding assistants to boost engineer productivity\" [Q4 FY2024]. Free cash flow reached $13.2B in Q4 alone despite heavy capex.\n2025\nCapex guidance jumped to $66-72B for the full year—roughly $30B higher than 2024. Q1 FY2025 noted \"almost 1B monthly actives use Meta AI\" with deepening personalization and a standalone Meta AI app in development. By Q2 FY2025, AI recommendation models drove \"~5% more conversions on Instagram and 3% on Facebook,\" with generative creative tools powering \"a meaningful share of ad revenue, especially for smaller advertisers\" [Q2 FY2025]. Susan Li noted the company is \"exploring data-center financing partnerships to manage multi-gigawatt build\" [Q2 FY2025], signaling infrastructure scale now measured in power capacity rather than server counts. The forward message: \"2026 CapEx/expenses to keep growing with infra and talent\" [Q2 FY2025].",

      "reasoning": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the question about Meta's AI infrastructure investments. It provides comprehensive information including specific capital expenditure figures ($66-72B for 2025), details about data center financing partnerships, infrastructure scaling measured in power capacity, AI coding assistants for productivity, and year-over-year comparisons of depreciation reflecting infrastructure ramp. The answer covers multiple years (2022-2025) showing the investment trajectory and includes specific quotes from earnings calls. The only minor limitation is the lack of 2022 data, but this is acknowledged transparently."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.75,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the provided context but contains some issues. The information about 2024 Q4 results ($48.4B revenue, 48% margin, Meta AI scaling toward 1B users, Llama 4 capabilities) is accurately derived from the context. The 2025 information about Meta AI having ~1B monthly actives, the standalone app, AI recommendation improvements (5% Instagram, 3% Facebook conversions), and the data-center financing partnerships are all present in the context. However, there are some concerns: 1) The CapEx guidance of $66-72B is mentioned in the context for Q2 2025, but the answer states it as 'roughly $30B higher than 2024' - while this comparison appears in the context, the exact 2024 baseline isn't clearly stated. 2) The statement about 2022 having 'no retrieved evidence' is accurate. 3) The 2023 depreciation figures ($11.2B vs $15.5B) appear to be derived from the cash flow statement in Chunk 10, which shows 2023 depreciation of $11,178M and 2024 of $15,498M - this is accurate. 4) The claim that capex 'roughly tripled' from 2022-2025 is not directly supported by the context. 5) The Q1 FY2025 CapEx guidance was actually stated as $64-72B in Chunk 1, not $66-72B. Some minor inaccuracies and extrapolations reduce the score."

    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer is fully consistent with the ground truth and provides substantially more detail. The ground truth states Meta is investing heavily in AI infrastructure including GPU clusters, custom AI chips, and data center expansion. The generated answer confirms this with specific evidence: capex guidance of $66-72B for 2025 (roughly tripling from earlier years), mentions of 'multi-gigawatt build' for data centers, infrastructure ramp reflected in depreciation increases ($11.2B to $15.5B), and explicit statements about AI infrastructure investment. While the generated answer doesn't specifically mention 'custom AI chips' by name, it comprehensively covers the heavy AI infrastructure investment theme with concrete financial figures and timeline details that support and expand upon the ground truth claim."

We expect to make this available to all advertisers in the coming weeks. Next, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. Our primary focus remains investing capital back into the business with infrastructure and talent being our top priorities. Starting with headcount, our hiring continues to be targeted at technical roles within our company priorities. In the first quarter, the significant majority of the roughly 2,800 employees we added were to support our priorities of monetization, infrastructure, generative AI, regulation and compliance and Reality Labs. On infrastructure, we have 2 primary focuses to meet the growing compute needs of our services and AI initiatives.\n\n[Chunk 10] (Score: 3.123)\nand additional paid-in capital 83,228 73,253\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss (3,097) (2,155)\nRetained earnings 102,506 82,070\nTotal stockholders' equity 182,637 153,168\nTotal liabilities and stockholders' equity $ 276,054 $ 229,623\n6\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.
