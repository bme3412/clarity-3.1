(3) The specific reasons for Gaming decline ('lower semi-custom revenue') and Embedded decline ('inventory normalization') are not present in the provided context - these appear to be hallucinated details.

The YoY growth percentages are also correctly cited (78%, 94%, 122% respectively from chunks 6, 7, 8). The QoQ growth figures (16%, 17%) are accurate. The Gaming revenue comparisons are correct. However, there are some concerns: 1) The free cash flow figures have labeling issues - the answer mentions 'Q2 FY26' and 'Q3 FY26' which don't match the context's fiscal quarters (Q2 FY25, Q3 FY25, Q4 FY25). The context shows Q4 FY25 FCF of $15.5B (chunk 1/6), Q3 FY25 FCF of $16.8B (chunk 7), and Q2 FY25 FCF of $13.5B (chunk 8). The answer incorrectly states Q3 FY26 FCF as $22.1B - this appears to be from chunk 3 which shows $22.089B but the fiscal period context is unclear. 2) The claim that 'Data Center consistently represents ~90% of total company revenue' is approximately correct based on the numbers but is a calculation/inference rather than directly stated. The core financial data is accurate, but the fiscal quarter labeling errors and some minor inaccuracies reduce the faithfulness score."

The answer mixes accurate context-derived information with fabricated or incorrect figures, making it partially unfaithful to the source material."

While the generated answer doesn't explicitly mention 'GPU clusters' or 'custom AI chips' by name, it discusses AI infrastructure investment comprehensively and accurately reflects Meta's significant AI infrastructure spending.

However, there are minor issues: the answer states MI350 is for 'H2 2025' while the context says '355 in the second half of next year' (Chunk 3) - the answer conflates 350 series with 355. The answer also adds some organizational structure and framing language not explicitly in the context, though the underlying facts are supported. The note about NVIDIA market share data not being found is appropriate and honest."

The answer correctly covers AMD's open software stack approach and cloud deployment gains, but misses the comparative framing that positions NVIDIA as the dominant player.

The revenue figures for Q1 FY26 ($77.7B, +18%), Q4 FY25 ($76.4B, +18%), and Q3 FY25 ($70.1B, +13%) are accurately sourced from chunks 2, 5, and 3. The commercial bookings growth of 112% and RPO of $392B (+51%) with ~35% recognized in 12 months comes directly from chunk 4. The Q1 FY26 operating income of $38B (+24%) is from chunk 2. The service revenue ($59.4B) and product revenue ($17.1B) for Q4 FY25 are accurately derived from chunk 6. However, there are some minor issues: 1) The Intelligent Cloud segment figures in the table (Q4 FY25: $30.3B, Q3 FY25: $26.8B, Q2 FY25: $25.5B) don't exactly match the context - chunk 6 shows Q4 FY25 Intelligent Cloud at $29,878M (~$29.9B), chunk 7 shows Q3 at $26,751M (~$26.8B), and chunk 8 shows Q2 at $25,544M (~$25.5B). The Q4 figure of $30.3B appears to be slightly inflated. 2) The statement about 'Microsoft Cloud' revenue figures is not directly stated in the chunks for all quarters mentioned.
