      "reasoning": "The answer does not provide the requested FY2018 gross margin information. However, it is somewhat relevant in that it acknowledges the question and explains why it cannot be answered (the data is not in the provided sources). It's not completely irrelevant as it addresses the question directly, but it fails to provide the actual answer requested."

    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer is completely faithful to the provided context. The system correctly identified that the context only contains Q4 FY2025 data (as shown in Chunk 2 mentioning 'Q4', 'fiscal_year': '2025') and analyst questions (Chunk 1). The answer appropriately states that FY2018 gross margin data is 'Not found in provided sources' rather than hallucinating information. The response accurately acknowledges what is available (2025 Q4 earnings data) and what is not available (FY2018 financial metrics), demonstrating no hallucination."

      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the FY2018 gross margin information is not found in the provided sources, which matches the ground truth. The answer provides additional context explaining why (the sources only contain 2025 Q4 data), but this extra detail is consistent with and supports the ground truth conclusion."
