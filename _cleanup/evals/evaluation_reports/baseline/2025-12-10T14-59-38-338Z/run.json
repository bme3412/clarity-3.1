The answer correctly attributes the $4.5B to $5B guidance raise to Chunk 5, and the customer milestones explanation is accurate. The claim about compute business being ~$1.7 billion from Chunk 6 is also accurate. However, the answer presents analyst estimates/questions (the $1.5B Q3 and $2B Q4 figures) as if they were confirmed facts, when in the context they appear as analyst speculation ('It seems like it was in the $1.5 billion range').

The answer also confirms the AI GPU demand driver and provides extensive additional detail with specific revenue figures and citations.

The answer primarily provides historical/reported revenue figures (Q4 2025, Q1-Q3 2026 appear to be past results based on context) rather than forward guidance. The answer itself acknowledges 'Forward guidance for specific quarters: Not found in provided sources' and 'Specific quarterly guidance: Not found in provided sources.' While the answer provides some forward-looking information about Blackwell demand and $0.5T visibility, it doesn't provide the specific quarterly revenue guidance the user was asking for. The answer is partially relevant as it discusses revenue trends and future product momentum, but fails to directly answer the question about upcoming quarter guidance."

The revenue figures cited are generally accurate from the context - Q4 2025 at $39.3B, Q3 2026 at $57.0B, Q2 2026 at $46.7B are all verifiable. The Data Center figure of $35.6B for Q4 2025 is correct from Chunk 1. The networking revenue of $8.2B with 162% YoY growth is correctly cited from Chunk 4. The Blackwell demand being 'off the charts' and $0.5T visibility is accurately from Chunk 4. The 1,000 racks per week figure is from Chunk 6, not Chunk 8 as cited. However, there are some concerns: (1) Q1 2026 revenue is stated as $44.1B but the context shows $44.062B in Chunk 10, and the YoY growth of +69% is not explicitly stated in the context - Chunk 10 shows Q1 2025 vs Q1 2024 comparison. (2) The citation [C12] for Q1 2026 revenue doesn't match - Chunk 12 contains analyst questions, not financial data. (3) Some citations are slightly misattributed. The core financial facts are largely accurate but there are minor hallucinations in growth percentages and citation accuracy issues."
