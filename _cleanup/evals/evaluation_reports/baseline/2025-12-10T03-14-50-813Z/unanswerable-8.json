  "question": "What was Microsoft’s Copilot revenue in Q1 2022?",
  "ground_truth": "Not found in provided sources.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts Extracted:\n- Total revenue Q1 2022: $45.3B, YoY +22%, constant currency +20% [C11]\n- Gross margin: 69.9% [C13]\n- Operating income: $20.2B [C13]\n- Operating margin: 44.7% [C13]\n- Commercial bookings up 14% (slowdown from prior quarter's 25%) [C2]\n- Copilot-specific revenue or metrics: Not found in provided sources\n---\nCopilot revenue for Q1 2022: Not found in provided sources. The term \"Copilot\" does not appear in the provided context for this period.\nMicrosoft Q1 FY2022 Revenue Summary:\n- Total Revenue: $45.3B (YoY +22% / constant currency +20%) [C11][C13]\n- Gross Margin: 69.9% [C13]\n- Operating Income: $20.2B, Operating Margin: 44.7% [C13]\n- Operating Cash Flow: $24.5B [C13]\nCommercial bookings grew 14% YoY, decelerating from 25% in the prior quarter, with analysts seeking color on Azure's contribution to this change [C2]. Microsoft Cloud—comprising Azure, Dynamics 365, Microsoft 365, Power Platform, GitHub, and VS Code—drove large enterprise commitments through comprehensive deal scope and strong renewals [C3][C5][C6].\nNote: Copilot as a product/revenue line was not yet disclosed in Q1 FY2022 earnings materials. The provided sources contain no Copilot-specific financial data for this period.",
  "duration_ms": 14391,
  "metrics": {
    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the question. It correctly identifies that Copilot-specific revenue data was not available for Q1 2022, which is accurate since Microsoft Copilot products were not yet launched or disclosed at that time. The answer provides helpful context by sharing the overall Q1 2022 financial metrics that were available, and explicitly states multiple times that Copilot data is not found in the sources. This is a complete and honest response to the question, even though the specific data requested doesn't exist."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The answer is highly faithful to the provided context. Key facts are accurately extracted: Total revenue of $45.3B with +22% YoY growth (from C11/C13), gross margin of 69.9% (C13), operating income of $20.2B and operating margin of 44.7% (C13), operating cash flow of $24.5B (C13), and commercial bookings up 14% with reference to prior quarter's 25% (C2). The Microsoft Cloud components are correctly listed from C1/C5. The answer appropriately notes that Copilot data is not found in the sources, which is accurate - there is no mention of Copilot in any of the provided chunks. The only minor deduction is for the slight interpretation that Copilot 'was not yet disclosed' which goes slightly beyond what the context explicitly states, though it's a reasonable inference given the Q1 2022 timeframe."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that Copilot revenue/metrics were 'Not found in provided sources,' which matches the ground truth. The answer goes further by providing additional context about Q1 FY2022 financials and explaining that Copilot as a product was not yet disclosed during that period, but this additional detail is consistent with and supports the core finding that matches the ground truth."
