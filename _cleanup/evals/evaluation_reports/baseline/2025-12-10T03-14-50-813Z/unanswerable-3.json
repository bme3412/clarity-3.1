  "ground_truth": "Not found in provided sources.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts Extracted\n- AWS revenue guidance for 2026: Not found in provided sources.\n- AWS 2026 revenue projections: Not found in provided sources.\n- Any forward guidance specifically for fiscal year 2026: Not found in provided sources.\n---\n Final Answer\nAWS revenue guidance for 2026: Not found in provided sources.\nThe provided context contains historical AWS performance data through Q3 2025 and Q4 2024, including commentary on AWS growth momentum and segment margins, but does not include any explicit revenue guidance or projections for fiscal year 2026. Management commentary references AWS \"growing at a pace we haven't seen\" [C1] and provides Q2 2025 AWS operating income of $10.2B with margins declining from 39.5% to 32.9% QoQ [C2], but these are backward-looking metrics rather than forward guidance for 2026.",
  "duration_ms": 10624,
  "metrics": {
    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is relevant and directly addresses the question about whether Amazon provided 2026 AWS revenue guidance. It clearly states that no such guidance was found in the provided sources, and explains what information was available (historical data through Q3 2025, Q4 2024 performance metrics). The answer appropriately distinguishes between backward-looking metrics and forward guidance. The score is not 1.0 because the answer is somewhat verbose with the 'Atomic Facts Extracted' section, but it does effectively answer the user's yes/no question with appropriate context."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer is completely faithful to the provided context. The response correctly states that AWS revenue guidance for 2026 is not found in the provided sources. The context contains only historical data from Q3 2024, Q4 2024, Q3 2025, and Q2 2025 (based on the segment margins chunk), but no forward-looking guidance for fiscal year 2026. The answer appropriately references specific details from the context (AWS operating income of $10.2B, margins of 39.5% to 32.9%) while accurately noting these are backward-looking metrics. The answer does not hallucinate or fabricate any information not present in the context."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that AWS revenue guidance for 2026 is 'Not found in provided sources,' which matches the ground truth exactly. The generated answer provides additional context explaining why the information wasn't found (historical data available but no forward guidance for 2026), which is consistent with and more detailed than the ground truth. The extra detail does not contradict the core finding."
