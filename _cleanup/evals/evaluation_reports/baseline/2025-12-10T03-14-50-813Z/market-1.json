  "question": "How is the cloud computing market affecting Microsoft's business?",
  "ground_truth": "Microsoft Azure continues to show strong growth driven by AI services and enterprise cloud adoption, contributing significantly to overall revenue growth.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts Extracted\n- Azure and other cloud services revenue increased 40% (up 39% in constant currency) in Q1 2026 [C1]\n- Azure and other cloud services revenue increased 39% in Q4 2025 [C2]\n- Intelligent Cloud segment revenue was $30.9B in Q1 2026, up 28% (27% constant currency) [C1]\n- Intelligent Cloud segment revenue was $29.9B in Q4 2025, up 26% (25% constant currency) [C2]\n- Intelligent Cloud segment revenue was $26.8B in Q3 2025, up 21% (22% constant currency) [C3]\n- Intelligent Cloud segment revenue was $25.5B in Q2 2025, up 19% [C4]\n- Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 51% to $392B in Q1 2026 [C1]\n- Microsoft has architected Azure for distributed computing fabric emphasizing hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructures [C5]\n- Azure hybrid benefits support both lift-and-shift and modern cloud-native applications, aligning with customer needs for operational sovereignty and compliance [C6]\n---\n Final Answer\nAzure remains Microsoft's primary growth engine, with revenue accelerating to 40% growth in Q1 2026 [C1] from 31% in Q2 2025 [C4]. The Intelligent Cloud segment reached $30.9B in Q1 2026 [C1], demonstrating sequential expansion from $25.5B four quarters earlier [C4].\nCommercial remaining performance obligation surged 51% to $392B [C1], signaling robust contracted backlog and forward revenue visibility. This metric reflects enterprise commitment to long-term Azure consumption.\nStrategically, Microsoft's distributed computing architecture supports hybrid and multi-cloud deployments [C5], addressing enterprise requirements for operational sovereignty and compliance [C6]. This positioning enables capture of workloads spanning lift-and-shift migrations and cloud-native applications [C6].\nMarket impact metrics beyond Azure growth rates—such as market share figures or competitive positioning data—not found in provided sources.",

      "reasoning": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the question about how cloud computing is affecting Microsoft's business. It provides specific revenue figures for Azure and the Intelligent Cloud segment, growth percentages across multiple quarters, commercial performance obligations, and strategic positioning information. The answer demonstrates clear positive impact of cloud computing on Microsoft's business through concrete metrics. The only minor limitation is that it acknowledges the absence of market share and competitive positioning data, but this transparency is appropriate given the source constraints."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the context, correctly citing Azure growth rates (40% in Q1 2026, 39% in Q4 2025, 33% in Q3 2025, 31% in Q2 2025), Intelligent Cloud segment revenues and growth percentages, and the $392B commercial remaining performance obligation. The strategic points about distributed computing fabric and hybrid/multi-cloud architecture are accurately drawn from the context. However, there are minor issues: (1) The answer states Azure grew 31% in Q2 2025, which is correct per Chunk 1, but the atomic facts section incorrectly labels some chunk references (e.g., [C4] for Q2 2025 data is actually Chunk 1). (2) The answer appropriately acknowledges when information is not found in sources. The core financial data and strategic positioning claims are well-supported by the provided context."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer strongly supports the ground truth's claim about Azure's strong growth. It provides specific revenue figures (40% growth in Q1 2026, Intelligent Cloud reaching $30.9B) and mentions enterprise cloud adoption through metrics like commercial remaining performance obligation ($392B, up 51%). However, the generated answer does not explicitly mention 'AI services' as a growth driver, which is a key element in the ground truth. The answer focuses on hybrid/multi-cloud architecture and enterprise compliance rather than AI. The factual content about growth is accurate and more detailed than the ground truth, but the omission of AI as a specific driver warrants a slight penalty."
