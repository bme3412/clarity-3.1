The citation references (C5, C8, C10, etc.) don't match the actual chunk numbers in the context. The FY2026 Q2 Data Center revenue of $41.1B is correctly sourced from Chunk 1. The FY2025 Q4 Data Center revenue of $35.6B is correctly found in Chunk 9. However, the answer incorrectly attributes some figures - for example, the structured JSON data in Chunks 15-17 shows total revenue figures, not specifically Data Center revenue breakouts. The $30.771B and $26.272B figures from the JSON chunks appear to be Data Center values based on the 'data_center' field in the revenueSegments. The TTM calculation methodology is reasonable but the answer acknowledges uncertainty about Q3 FY2026 data. The Blackwell $11B figure is correctly sourced from Chunk 9. Some claims like the FY2025 full-year $115.2B are correctly from Chunk 9. The main faithfulness issues are: mismatched citation numbers, and some figures pulled from JSON structures that require interpretation.

The mention of gross margin expectations for MI300 potentially shifting is supported by Chunk 3's question about whether 'the accretion point moved out a little bit.' However, the answer takes some interpretive liberties: stating that software is the 'primary hurdle to broader customer ramp' is an inference rather than explicit in the context, and characterizing MI300 margin contribution timing as 'extended' goes slightly beyond what the question in Chunk 3 actually confirms. The answer appropriately notes what was not found in sources. Minor deduction for slight over-interpretation of the context."

The answer primarily provides historical revenue data (Q1-Q3 FY26 actual results) rather than guidance. It explicitly states 'Explicit Q4 FY26 revenue guidance: Not found in provided sources' twice, acknowledging the guidance was not found. While the answer does mention forward visibility to $0.5T in cumulative Blackwell/Rubin revenue and qualitative demand commentary, it fails to provide the specific numerical revenue guidance for upcoming quarters that the user was asking about.

The revenue figures for Q3 FY26 ($57.006B), Q2 FY26 ($46.743B), and Q1 FY26 ($44.062B) are accurately extracted from the context. The $0.5T Blackwell/Rubin visibility claim is directly from Chunk 1 (Jensen Huang's statement). The networking revenue of $8.2B with 162% YoY growth is correctly cited from Chunk 1. The GB300 production rate of 1,000 racks per week is found in Chunk 3 (not Chunk 6 as cited, but the information is present). The Rubin roadmap information is accurately derived from the context. However, there are minor issues: (1) The citation [C5] for Q3 revenue should reference the financial data chunks, not Chunk 5 which contains different information; (2) The Q4 FY26 guidance of $65B is actually present in Chunk 4 ('q4_guidance': 'revenue': '65.0 ±2% billion USD') but the answer states it was 'not found' - this is a factual error/omission. The answer correctly acknowledges when information is not found for some items, but missed the Q4 guidance that was available."

However, the generated answer explicitly states 'Explicit Q4 FY26 revenue guidance: Not found in provided sources,' which means it doesn't directly confirm specific forward guidance figures. The answer demonstrates sustained growth in data center-related revenue through networking and AI infrastructure metrics, which aligns with the ground truth. The score is reduced slightly because while the evidence strongly implies optimistic outlook, the explicit guidance statement is missing."
