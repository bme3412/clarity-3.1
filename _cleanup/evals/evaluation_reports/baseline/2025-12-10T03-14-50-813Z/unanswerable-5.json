  "question": "How many MI325X units did AMD ship in 2022?",
  "ground_truth": "Not found in provided sources.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts Extracted:\n- MI325X GPU is mentioned as a product in 2024 Q3 context [C3]\n- No MI325X data appears in any 2022 context [C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C13]\n- No GPU shipment unit data found in 2022 context\n- No GPU unit sales figures found in 2022 context\n---\nMI325X: Not found in provided sources for 2022. The MI325X GPU appears only in 2024 Q3 materials as a product announcement [C3], indicating it did not exist as a product in 2022.\nGPU Shipments (2022): Not found in provided sources. The 2022 quarterly financial data [C7, C9, C11, C13] and earnings transcripts [C6, C8, C10, C12] do not contain GPU unit shipment figures.\nGPU Unit Sales (2022): Not found in provided sources. The 2022 context discusses operating challenges including weak PC markets, supply constraints, and China weakness [C6, C8, C12], but no discrete GPU unit sales metrics are provided.\nThe 2022 financial data shows quarterly revenue figures (Q1: $5.9B, Q2: $6.6B, Q3: $5.6B, Q4: $5.6B) [C7, C9, C11, C13] but does not break out GPU-specific shipments or unit volumes. Segment composition data fields are null across all 2022 quarters [C7, C9, C11, C13].",

      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is highly relevant to the question. It directly addresses whether MI325X units were shipped in 2022 by explaining that the MI325X did not exist as a product in 2022 (it only appears in 2024 Q3 materials). The answer also thoroughly explains that no GPU shipment unit data was found in the 2022 sources. While the answer could be more concise, it correctly and completely addresses the question by explaining why the requested information cannot be provided - the product didn't exist at that time."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the provided context. It correctly identifies that MI325X appears only in 2024 context (Chunk 6 mentions it as a product), not in 2022 materials. The answer accurately states that no GPU unit shipment data is found in the 2022 context, which is true - the financial chunks (10-13) show quarterly revenue but segment composition is null. The answer correctly cites the quarterly revenue figures from the 2022 data. However, there are minor issues: the chunk references in brackets don't perfectly align with the actual chunk numbers provided (e.g., citing C3 for MI325X when it's actually in Chunk 6), and some operating challenges mentioned are accurately drawn from the metadata in chunks 1, 2, and 4. The core claims about data availability are faithful to the context."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly concludes that the information was not found in the provided sources, which matches the ground truth. While the generated answer provides significantly more detail about what was searched and why the information wasn't available (explaining that MI325X only appears in 2024 Q3 materials, that 2022 financial data doesn't contain GPU unit shipment figures, etc.), the core factual conclusion is the same: the requested information is not available in the sources. The additional context and explanation is consistent with and supports the ground truth answer."

As we look through the other segments, I think China is -- has been very weak in 2022, and we're not forecasting a significant recovery in 2023. So, we'll see how that goes.
