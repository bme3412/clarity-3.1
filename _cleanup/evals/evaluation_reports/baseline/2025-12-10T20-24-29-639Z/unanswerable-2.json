    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.3,
      "reasoning": "The answer acknowledges the question and attempts to address it, but ultimately fails to provide the requested information. It correctly identifies that the data wasn't available in the provided sources, which shows relevance to the question. However, since no actual gross margin figure for FY2018 was provided, the answer doesn't fulfill the user's information need. The partial score reflects that the response was on-topic and transparent about limitations, but didn't answer the actual question."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer is completely faithful to the provided context. The generated answer correctly states that Apple's gross margin for FY2018 is not found in the provided sources. This is accurate because the context only contains Q4 FY2025 earnings data (showing total revenue of $102.5 billion) and analyst questions - there is no information about FY2018 gross margins. The answer appropriately acknowledges the limitation of the available context rather than hallucinating information."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the information about Apple's gross margin for FY2018 is not found in the provided sources, which matches the ground truth. The answer provides additional context explaining why (the sources only contain Q4 FY2025 data), but this extra detail is consistent with and supports the ground truth conclusion."
