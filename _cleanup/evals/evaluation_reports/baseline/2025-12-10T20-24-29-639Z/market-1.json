  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n• Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud revenue increased 17% (up 15% in constant currency) in 2026 Q1 [C1]\n• Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud revenue increased 18% (up 16% in constant currency) in 2025 Q4 [C2]\n• Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud revenue increased 12% (up 15% in constant currency) in 2025 Q3 [C3]\n• Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud revenue increased 16% (up 15% in constant currency) in 2025 Q2 [C4]\n• Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 51% to $392 billion in 2026 Q1 [C1]\n• Azure is architected for distributed computing fabric, emphasizing hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructures [C5]\n• Microsoft 365 is evolving into the new operating system by expanding its Total Addressable Market (TAM) [C6]\n• Revenue transitions from on-premises KPIs to Azure consumption, reflecting integrated cloud strategy [C6]\n Final Answer:\nCloud computing is driving strong growth across Microsoft's cloud services. Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud revenue has shown consistent double-digit growth: 16% in Q2 2025, 12% in Q3 2025, 18% in Q4 2025, and 17% in Q1 2026 [C4][C3][C2][C1]. Commercial remaining performance obligation surged 51% to $392 billion, indicating robust future cloud demand [C1].\nMicrosoft's cloud strategy centers on distributed computing architecture supporting hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructures, positioning the company for low-latency applications across factory floors, hospitals, and gaming [C5]. The business model aligns with customer needs for operational sovereignty and compliance, with revenue transitioning from on-premises to Azure consumption [C6].\nMicrosoft 365 is expanding its addressable market by evolving into a comprehensive operating system platform, targeting first-line workers and various business segments [C6]. This cloud-first transformation reflects Microsoft's integrated approach to capturing the broader cloud computing opportunity.",

      "score": 0.9,
      "reasoning": "The answer directly addresses how cloud computing is affecting Microsoft's business with specific, relevant data points. It covers revenue growth percentages for Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud across multiple quarters, mentions the 51% increase in commercial remaining performance obligation, discusses Azure's architecture strategy, and explains the business model transition to cloud consumption. The answer is comprehensive, well-cited, and directly responsive to the question about cloud computing's impact on Microsoft's business. The only minor limitation is that it could have included more specific Azure revenue figures or competitive positioning data, but overall it thoroughly addresses the question."

    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the context, but contains some citation mapping errors. The growth percentages are correct but the citations are misaligned: the answer cites [C4] for Q2 2025 data but that data appears in Chunk 1, not Chunk 4. Similarly, [C3] is cited for Q3 2025 but that data is in Chunk 2, [C2] for Q4 2025 but that's in Chunk 3, and [C1] for Q1 2026 but that's in Chunk 4. The content about distributed computing, hybrid infrastructure, and Microsoft 365 as an operating system is accurately derived from Chunks 5 and 6. The $392 billion commercial remaining performance obligation figure is correctly sourced from Chunk 4. The answer doesn't contain hallucinations - all facts are present in the context - but the citation numbering system appears to reference the atomic facts list rather than the actual chunks, which could cause confusion."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.6,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer discusses Microsoft's cloud growth extensively but focuses primarily on Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud revenue rather than Azure specifically. The ground truth emphasizes Azure's strong growth driven by AI services and enterprise cloud adoption. While the generated answer mentions Azure in the context of architecture and revenue transitions, it doesn't directly address Azure's growth metrics or the AI services driving that growth. The answer is related to cloud computing growth at Microsoft but misses the specific focus on Azure and AI services that the ground truth highlights. The information provided appears factually consistent but doesn't directly answer the same question the ground truth addresses."
