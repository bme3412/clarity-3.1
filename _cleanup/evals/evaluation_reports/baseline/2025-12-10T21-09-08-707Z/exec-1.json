  "question": "What did AMD's CEO say about AI demand in recent earnings?",
  "ground_truth": "AMD CEO Lisa Su emphasized strong AI demand, particularly for MI300 accelerators, and outlined plans to expand AI product portfolio to capture growing market opportunity.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations\n• Not found in provided sources - AMD CEO's specific statements about AI demand\n• Not found in provided sources - Direct quotes from AMD's CEO regarding AI market outlook\n• Not found in provided sources - CEO commentary on AI demand trends or forecasts\n• Supply constraints mentioned in wafers, substrates, and back-end assembly across multiple quarters [C1][C2][C3]\n• High demand exceeding supply mentioned in some segments [C2][C3]\n• References to MI300 gross margin expectations and accretion point timing [C1]\n• Software investment challenges noted as hurdle for customer ramp [C2]\n Final Answer\nNot found in provided sources. The context fragments from AMD's Q1, Q2, and Q3 2024 earnings calls do not contain direct statements from AMD's CEO about AI demand. While the transcripts reference supply constraints across wafers, substrates, and back-end assembly [C1][C2][C3], and mention high demand exceeding supply in certain segments [C2][C3], specific CEO commentary on AI demand trends is not present in the provided excerpts. The context includes discussion of MI300 gross margin expectations [C1] and software investment challenges for customer ramp [C2], but lacks the CEO's direct statements about AI market demand that would be needed to answer this query.",

      "reasoning": "The answer acknowledges it cannot find direct CEO quotes about AI demand, which is honest and relevant. However, it does provide related context from AMD earnings calls about supply constraints, high demand, and MI300 products that are tangentially related to AI demand. The answer is partially relevant because it addresses the topic area (AMD earnings, AI-related products) but fails to directly answer what the CEO specifically said about AI demand. The transparency about limitations is appropriate, but the answer doesn't fully satisfy the user's question."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the provided context. It correctly identifies that the specific CEO statements about AI demand are not present in the chunks, which is accurate - the chunks only contain metadata about operating environment challenges and partial analyst questions, not CEO responses. The answer appropriately cites the supply constraints, high demand exceeding supply, MI300 gross margin discussions, and software investment challenges that ARE present in the context metadata. The slight deduction is because the answer implies these are from 'transcripts' when the chunks only show metadata and partial questions, not actual transcript content with CEO statements. However, the core claim that CEO statements about AI demand are 'not found' is accurate and faithful to what was provided."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.2,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer claims the information about AMD CEO's statements on AI demand was 'not found in provided sources' and fails to mention Lisa Su by name or the key facts from the ground truth: strong AI demand emphasis, MI300 accelerators specifically, and plans to expand AI product portfolio. While the generated answer does mention MI300 and some related topics (gross margins, supply constraints), it explicitly states it cannot answer the core question about CEO statements on AI demand. The ground truth clearly indicates this information should have been available and answerable. The generated answer is overly cautious and misses the key substantive content."
