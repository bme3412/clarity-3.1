  "question": "How has Nvidia's data center revenue changed over the past year?",
  "ground_truth": "Nvidia's data center revenue has grown significantly, driven by AI GPU demand. The segment has shown consistent triple-digit growth rates throughout FY2024-2025.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations\n- Q4 2025 data center revenue: $35.6B (QoQ +16% / YoY +93%) [C1]\n- Q3 2025 data center revenue: $30.8B (QoQ +17% / YoY +112%) [C2]  \n- Q2 2025 data center revenue: $26.3B (QoQ +16% / YoY +154%) [C2]\n- Q4 2024 data center revenue: $18.4B (QoQ +27% / YoY +409%) [C5]\n- Q3 2024 data center revenue: $14.5B (QoQ +41% / YoY +279%) [C6]\n- FY2024 full-year data center revenue: $47.5B (+217% YoY) [C5]\n Final Answer\nData center revenue: $35.6B (YoY +93% / QoQ +16%) [C1]\nNVIDIA's data center revenue has experienced explosive growth over the past year. From Q4 2024's $18.4B [C5] to Q4 2025's $35.6B [C1], the segment nearly doubled with 93% year-over-year growth [C1]. The trajectory shows consistent acceleration: Q2 2025 delivered $26.3B with 154% YoY growth [C2], Q3 2025 reached $30.8B with 112% YoY growth [C2], culminating in Q4 2025's $35.6B [C1].\nSequential growth remained robust throughout 2025, with quarterly increases of 16-17% [C1][C2]. This represents a dramatic expansion from the $14.5B quarterly run rate in Q3 2024 [C6], when the segment was already posting 279% year-over-year gains [C6]. The full fiscal year 2024 data center revenue of $47.5B [C5] has been substantially exceeded by just the most recent quarter alone.",

    "relevance": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer directly and comprehensively addresses the question about how Nvidia's data center revenue has changed over the past year. It provides specific quarterly revenue figures from Q3 2024 through Q4 2025, includes both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth percentages, and offers clear analysis of the growth trajectory. The answer includes citations and presents the data in a well-organized format that clearly demonstrates the revenue changes over the specified time period."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the context but contains some inaccuracies and unsupported claims. The main data center revenue figure of $35.6B with QoQ +16% and YoY +93% is correctly cited from Chunk 1. The Q3 2025 figure of $30.8B (actually 30,771) with QoQ +17% and YoY +112% is correctly derived from Chunk 3. The Q2 2025 figure of $26.3B (actually 26,272) with QoQ +16% and YoY +154% is correctly from Chunk 4. However, the Q4 2024 and Q3 2024 figures cited as $18.4B and $14.5B respectively come from Chunks 5 and 6, but these chunks don't clearly establish these as Q4 2024 and Q3 2024 specifically - they mention 'Fourth-quarter revenue' and 'record revenue' without explicit fiscal year labeling. The FY2024 full-year data center revenue of $47.5B from Chunk 6 is accurate. The answer makes reasonable inferences from the data but some of the quarter labeling (Q4 2024, Q3 2024) is interpretive rather than explicitly stated in the context. The overall narrative about growth trends is supported by the data."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer fully supports and significantly expands upon the ground truth. The ground truth states that Nvidia's data center revenue has grown significantly with consistent triple-digit growth rates throughout FY2024-2025. The generated answer provides detailed evidence of this: Q4 2024 showed 409% YoY growth, Q3 2024 showed 279% YoY growth, Q2 2025 showed 154% YoY growth, Q3 2025 showed 112% YoY growth, and Q4 2025 showed 93% YoY growth. While Q4 2025's 93% is technically not triple-digit, the answer demonstrates that throughout most of FY2024-2025, triple-digit growth was indeed consistent, and the overall trajectory confirms significant growth driven by AI GPU demand (data center segment). The generated answer is factually consistent with and more detailed than the ground truth."

Starting with data center. The continued ramp of the NVIDIA HGX platform based on our Hopper Tensor Core GPU architecture, along with InfiniBand end-to-end networking, drove record revenue of $14.5 billion, up 41% sequentially and up 279% year-on-year. NVIDIA HGX with InfiniBand together are essentially the reference architecture for AI supercomputers and data center infrastructures. Some of the most exciting generative AI applications are built and run on NVIDIA, including Adobe, Firefly, ChatGPT, Microsoft 365 Copilot, CoAssist, Now Assist with ServiceNow and Zoom AI Companion.
