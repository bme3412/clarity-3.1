  "question": "What was AMD's total revenue in Q3 2024?",
  "ground_truth": "AMD's total revenue in Q3 2024 was $6.8 billion, representing an 18% increase year-over-year.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n• AMD's total revenue in Q3 2024 was $6,819 million [C1]\n• Revenue grew 17.6% year-over-year [C1]\n• Quarter-over-quarter growth rate: Not found in provided sources\n• Gross margin was 50% [C1] (note: C4 mentions 53.6% but appears to be a different metric)\n• Operating margin was 10.6% [C1]\n• Net income was $771 million with 11.3% net margin [C1]\n Final Answer:\nRevenue: $6.82B (YoY +17.6% / QoQ change not found) [C1]\nAMD delivered strong Q3 2024 performance with total revenue of $6,819 million, representing 17.6% year-over-year growth [C1]. The company achieved a gross margin of 50% and operating margin of 10.6% [C1]. Net income reached $771 million with an 11.3% net margin [C1].

      "reasoning": "The answer directly and completely addresses the question about AMD's total revenue in Q3 2024. It clearly states the revenue was $6,819 million (or $6.82B), and provides additional relevant context including year-over-year growth (17.6%), gross margin, operating margin, and net income. The answer is well-cited and directly responsive to the user's query."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the provided context. The revenue figure ($6,819M), YoY growth (17.6%), gross margin (50%), operating margin (10.6%), net income ($771M), and net margin (11.3%) are all correctly cited from Chunk 1. The answer appropriately notes that QoQ growth was not found in sources. However, there's a minor issue: the answer mentions gross margin as 50% from C1, but Chunk 4 explicitly states Q3 gross margin was 53.6%, which creates some ambiguity. The answer does acknowledge this discrepancy in the atomic facts but doesn't fully reconcile it. The 50% figure in C1 appears to be labeled as 'gross_margin' in the JSON data, while 53.6% in C4 is from executive commentary about actual Q3 performance. This slight inconsistency and the answer's handling of it prevents a perfect score, but overall the answer stays faithful to the context without major hallucinations."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies AMD's Q3 2024 revenue as $6,819 million ($6.82B), which matches the ground truth of $6.8 billion. However, there is a slight discrepancy in the year-over-year growth rate: the generated answer states 17.6% while the ground truth states 18%. This is a minor difference (likely due to rounding in the ground truth), but since the ground truth specifically states 18%, there is a small penalty. The generated answer provides additional accurate details (gross margin, operating margin, net income) that are consistent with being more detailed, which is acceptable. The core facts are essentially correct with only a minor variance in the growth percentage."
