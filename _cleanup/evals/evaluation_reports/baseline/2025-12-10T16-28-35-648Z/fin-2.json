  "question": "How did the AMD Data Center segment perform in Q3 2024?",
  "ground_truth": "The Data Center segment revenue reached a record $3.5 billion in Q3 2024, up 122% year-over-year, driven by strong sales of AMD Instinct GPUs and EPYC CPUs.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n• Data Center GPU revenue was very strong in Q3 2024 [C5]\n• Data Center GPU revenue was approaching the size of the compute business, which was around $1.7 billion [C6]\n• September actuals for Data Center GPU were in the $1.5 billion range [C4]\n• AMD raised overall Data Center GPU guidance for 2024 from exceeding $4.5 billion to exceeding $5 billion [C5]\n• The guidance increase was based on completion of customer milestones and ramping above initial expectations [C5]\n• December Data Center GPU revenue projected to be in the $2 billion range [C4]\n Final Answer:\nData Center GPU Revenue: ~$1.5B in September, approaching $1.7B for Q3 (guidance raised to exceed $5B for full year 2024) [C4][C5][C6]\nAMD's Data Center GPU segment delivered very strong Q3 performance, with revenue approaching the size of their compute business at around $1.7 billion [C6]. September actuals were approximately $1.5 billion [C4]. The company raised full-year 2024 guidance from exceeding $4.5 billion to exceeding $5 billion, representing a $500 million increase [C5]. This guidance raise was driven by completion of customer milestones and ramping above initial expectations [C5]. December revenue is projected to reach approximately $2 billion [C4].\nQuarterly growth rates and margins: Not found in provided sources.",

    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is highly relevant to the question about AMD Data Center segment performance in Q3 2024. It provides specific revenue figures (~$1.5B in September, approaching $1.7B), guidance updates (raised to exceed $5B for full year), and growth drivers. However, the answer focuses primarily on the Data Center GPU sub-segment rather than the entire Data Center segment as a whole, which may include other components. The answer also acknowledges missing information about quarterly growth rates and margins. Overall, it substantially addresses the question with specific, cited data points."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the context, with most claims properly supported. The $1.5B September figure [C4], the ~$1.7B compute business comparison [C6], the guidance raise from $4.5B to $5B [C5], and the customer milestones explanation [C5] are all directly from the context. However, there are minor issues: (1) The December $2B projection in C4 is framed as an analyst's question/speculation ('that would put December in kind of the $2 billion range'), not a confirmed figure, yet the answer presents it more definitively. (2) The answer states 'September actuals were approximately $1.5 billion' but the context shows this was an analyst's estimate ('It seems like it was in the $1.5 billion range'), not confirmed actuals. These are presented with slightly more certainty than the source material warrants, but the core information is accurate."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.3,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer focuses on Data Center GPU revenue specifically (~$1.5B-$1.7B range), while the ground truth refers to the entire Data Center segment revenue ($3.5 billion). These are different metrics - the GPU portion is a subset of the total segment. The generated answer does not mention the key facts from the ground truth: the $3.5 billion total segment revenue, the 122% year-over-year growth, or the specific mention of AMD Instinct GPUs and EPYC CPUs as drivers. While the generated answer provides accurate information about the GPU portion and guidance, it fails to capture the main facts stated in the ground truth about overall segment performance."
