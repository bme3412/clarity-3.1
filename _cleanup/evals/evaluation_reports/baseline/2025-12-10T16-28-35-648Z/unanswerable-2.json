      "reasoning": "The answer acknowledges the question about Apple's FY2018 gross margin but does not provide the actual answer. Instead, it correctly identifies that the information was not available in the provided sources. While this is an honest and transparent response about the limitation of available data, it does not actually answer the user's question with the requested information. The response is partially relevant because it addresses the topic (Apple's gross margin) and explains why it cannot provide the specific data, but it fails to deliver the actual information requested."

      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer is completely faithful to the provided context. The generated answer correctly states that FY2018 gross margin data is not found in the provided sources, and accurately notes that the context only contains 2025 Q4 financial information. This is true - the provided chunks only contain Q4 FY2025 data and analyst questions, with no FY2018 gross margin information present. The answer does not hallucinate or fabricate any information."

    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the FY2018 gross margin data is not found in the provided sources, which matches the ground truth. The generated answer provides additional context explaining why the information isn't available (the sources only contain 2025 Q4 data), but this additional detail is consistent with and supports the ground truth answer."
