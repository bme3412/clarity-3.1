      "reasoning": "The answer is relevant and appropriately addresses the question by clearly stating that the specific information about MI325X units shipped in 2022 was not found in the available sources. The response is honest about the limitations of the data while providing related financial context that was available. This is a responsible answer that doesn't fabricate information. However, it's worth noting that MI325X wasn't actually released until 2024, so the question itself may be based on a false premise, which the answer could have mentioned for full completeness."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the provided context. It correctly states that MI325X product information, GPU unit shipment data, and GPU unit sales figures are not found in the provided sources - this is accurate as the context contains only quarterly financial summaries and earnings call metadata, not product-specific GPU data. The quarterly revenue figures cited are accurate from the context (Q1: $5,887M, Q2: $6,550M, Q3: $5,565M, Q4: $5,599M) and the growth percentages match (70.9%, 70.1%, 29%, 16%). However, there's a minor issue with the citation labels - the answer uses [C1][C2][C3][C4] but maps them inconsistently (e.g., saying Q4 is [C1] when Chunk 1 is actually Q1 data). The context does mention supply chain challenges and market conditions in the metadata sections, which the answer references. The answer appropriately acknowledges the limitations of the provided context rather than hallucinating information."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.9,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the specific information requested (MI325X, GPU shipments, unit sales for 2022) was not found in the provided sources, which aligns with the ground truth of 'Not found in provided sources.' The generated answer goes beyond the ground truth by providing additional context about what WAS available in the sources (quarterly revenue figures), which is consistent and helpful additional information. The core factual claim matches the ground truth - the requested information was not found. A small deduction is made because the ground truth is a simple 'not found' statement, while the generated answer adds substantial detail that, while accurate and relevant, goes significantly beyond what was asked."
