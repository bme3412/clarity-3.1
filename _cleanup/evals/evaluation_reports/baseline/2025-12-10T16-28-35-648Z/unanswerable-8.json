  "question": "What was Microsoft’s Copilot revenue in Q1 2022?",
  "ground_truth": "Not found in provided sources.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n• Total revenue: $45.3B (YoY +22%) [C1]\n• Gross profit: $31.7B [C1] \n• Gross margin: 69.9% [C1]\n• Operating income: $20.2B [C1]\n• Operating margin: 44.7% [C1]\n• Net income: $20.5B [C1]\n• Operating cash flow: $24.5B [C1]\n• Commercial bookings up 14% (slowdown from prior quarter's 25%) [C3]\n• Copilot revenue: Not found in provided sources\n• Copilot-specific metrics: Not found in provided sources\n Final Answer:\nCopilot revenue for Q1 2022: Not found in provided sources.\nMicrosoft's Q1 2022 overall financial performance:\n- Revenue: $45.3B (YoY +22%) [C1]\n- Gross margin: 69.9% [C1] \n- Operating margin: 44.7% [C1]\nCommercial bookings grew 14%, representing a deceleration from the prior quarter's 25% growth [C3]. The provided context contains comprehensive Microsoft financial data but does not include any Copilot-specific revenue figures or metrics for Q1 2022.",
  "duration_ms": 11283,
  "metrics": {
    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.8,
      "reasoning": "The answer is relevant and honest. It directly addresses the question by clearly stating that Copilot revenue for Q1 2022 was 'Not found in provided sources.' This is a truthful and appropriate response when the specific information isn't available. The answer also provides helpful context by sharing related Microsoft financial data from Q1 2022, which demonstrates the system searched the relevant documents. The only reason it's not a perfect 1.0 is that the additional financial details, while contextually useful, weren't specifically requested."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The answer is highly faithful to the provided context. All financial figures cited (revenue $45.3B, gross profit $31.7B, gross margin 69.9%, operating income $20.2B, operating margin 44.7%, net income $20.5B, operating cash flow $24.5B) are directly derived from Chunk 1. The commercial bookings information (14% growth, slowdown from 25%) is accurately taken from Chunk 3. The answer correctly states that Copilot revenue information is not found in the provided sources, which is accurate as no Copilot data appears in any chunk. The only minor issue is the revenue growth calculation - the context shows 22% growth and $45,317 (in millions), which the answer correctly rounds to $45.3B. The answer appropriately avoids hallucinating information not present in the context."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.7,
      "reasoning": "The ground truth indicates the answer should be 'Not found in provided sources.' The generated answer does correctly state that Copilot revenue and Copilot-specific metrics were 'Not found in provided sources,' which aligns with the ground truth. However, the generated answer provides extensive additional financial information about Microsoft's Q1 2022 performance that goes beyond what was asked. While this additional information appears to be accurate and cited, the core question about Copilot revenue is correctly answered as not found. The score is reduced slightly because the answer is verbose and includes much extraneous information, but the key fact (Copilot revenue not found) is correctly stated."
