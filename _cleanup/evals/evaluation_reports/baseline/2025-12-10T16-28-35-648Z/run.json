However, there are two minor issues: 1) The context in Chunk 4 mentions Q3 gross margin was 53.6%, not 50% - the 50% in Chunk 1 appears to be a different metric (possibly gross_margin field vs actual reported). 2) The answer appropriately notes that quarter-over-quarter growth was not found, which is accurate.

The year-over-year growth is stated as 17.6% in the generated answer versus 18% in the ground truth. This is a minor discrepancy - 17.6% rounds to 18%, so the figures are essentially consistent. The generated answer actually provides more precision and additional details (gross profit, gross margin, net income, operating income) that are consistent with a comprehensive financial report. The slight difference in the percentage representation (17.6% vs 18%) is likely due to rounding in the ground truth, so this is a very minor penalty."

(2) The answer states 'September actuals were approximately $1.5 billion' but the context shows this was an analyst's estimate ('It seems like it was in the $1.5 billion range'), not confirmed actuals.

The answer directly addresses the question with concrete numbers and trends. However, the score is not perfect because: 1) The answer acknowledges incomplete data (missing Q1 2025 data center revenue), 2) The formatting is somewhat complex with multiple sections that could be more concise, and 3) There's some confusion with fiscal year naming conventions (Q2 2026 vs 2025). Despite these minor issues, the core question is well-addressed with relevant data."

First, the citations are incorrectly labeled (e.g., [C1] refers to Chunk 1, but the answer misattributes data). Looking at the actual chunks: Chunk 1 shows Q4 FY2025 data with data_center revenue of $35,600M (not $30.8B as stated). Chunk 2 shows Q3 FY2025 with data_center of $30,771M. Chunk 3 shows Q2 FY2025 with data_center of $26,272M. The answer incorrectly states Q4 2025 Data Center revenue as $30.8B when Chunk 1 clearly shows $35.6B. The Q2 2026 Data Center revenue of $41.1B from Chunk 4 is correct. The TTM total revenue of $130.497B is correctly cited from Chunk 11. However, the answer introduces confusion by mixing fiscal year quarters incorrectly and some revenue figures don't match the source data. The claim about Q1 2025 revenue of $26.044B appears to come from Chunk 10 which shows April 2024 data, not Q1 2025. The answer also makes claims about 'Blackwell platform momentum' citing [C7] but the relevant Blackwell information is in different chunks. While some facts are accurate, the misattribution of data center revenue figures and citation errors reduce faithfulness."

It demonstrates the growth trajectory from $26.3B to $41.1B in data center revenue, and mentions 56% YoY growth for Q2 2026. However, the ground truth specifically mentions 'consistent triple-digit growth rates throughout FY2024-2025' which the generated answer doesn't directly confirm - it shows 78%, 94%, and 122% YoY total revenue growth (not specifically data center), and 56% YoY for the most recent data center figure. The answer is consistent with 'significant growth driven by AI GPU demand' (mentioning Blackwell platform and GB200/GB300), but doesn't explicitly confirm the 'triple-digit growth rates' claim for the data center segment specifically.

It mentions on-device foundation models powering 'private AI experiences' and integration across the ecosystem (iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Vision Pro). However, the generated answer does not explicitly mention 'custom silicon' or the 'Neural Engine' which are specific technical details in the ground truth. The answer provides significantly more detail about specific products (Apple Watch variants) and language expansion that, while accurate and consistent, somewhat dilutes the focus on the core AI strategy elements. The key concepts of on-device processing, privacy focus, and ecosystem integration are present, but the omission of the Neural Engine/custom silicon aspect warrants a slight penalty."

It includes historical revenue figures (Q2-Q4 2025) mixed with what appear to be future quarters (Q1-Q2 2026), and explicitly states 'Forward Guidance: Not found in provided sources for specific upcoming quarter targets.' The answer does provide useful context about demand outlook and Blackwell visibility, but the core question about specific forward guidance is acknowledged as not directly answered.

The revenue figures for Q4 2025 ($39.3B, 78% YoY growth), Q3 2025 ($35.1B, 94% YoY growth), Q2 2025 ($30.0B, 122% YoY growth) are correctly cited from chunks 1-3. The Q2 2026 revenue of $46.7B is correctly from chunk 6. The Blackwell demand and $0.5T visibility claim is correctly from chunk 4. The GB300 production of 1,000 racks per week and Blackwell Ultra generating tens of billions are correctly from chunk 6. However, there are some issues: 1) The Q1 2026 revenue of $44.1B is not clearly stated in chunk 9 - chunk 10 shows Q1 FY2025 revenue of $44,062M but this appears to be April 2025 data, not Q1 2026. 2) The QoQ +12% calculation for Q4 2025 is derived but not explicitly stated. 3) The answer references C9 for Q1 2026 revenue but chunk 9 shows Q2 FY2026 data (July 2025). The fiscal year labeling creates some confusion. Most core claims are supported but there are minor attribution errors and some derived calculations."

The generated answer provides extensive supporting evidence including specific revenue figures, Blackwell demand being 'off the charts,' visibility to $0.5T in Blackwell/Rubin revenue, and references to AI infrastructure spend reaching hundreds of billions. While the ground truth specifically mentions 'sustained growth in data center revenue,' the generated answer focuses on overall revenue and AI infrastructure demand more broadly, which aligns with the optimistic outlook theme. The generated answer provides much more detail and specific numbers than the ground truth, which is acceptable. However, it notes 'Forward Guidance: Not found in provided sources for specific upcoming quarter targets' which slightly contradicts the claim of having specific guidance, though it does provide future quarter revenue figures (Q1 2026, Q2 2026) that demonstrate the optimistic trajectory."

The answer correctly states that Copilot revenue information is not found in the provided sources, which is accurate as no Copilot data appears in any chunk.
