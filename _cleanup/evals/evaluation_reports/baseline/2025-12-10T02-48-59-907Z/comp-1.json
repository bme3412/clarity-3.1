The provided chunks contain forward-looking statements, risk factors, and general corporate information about AMD and NVIDIA, but they do not contain specific information that would answer a direct question about a particular topic. The chunks discuss various business risks, competitive factors, and corporate communications, but without knowing the original question, the system correctly identified that the specific information being sought was not present in these sources. This is an appropriate and honest response when the context does not contain the requested information."
