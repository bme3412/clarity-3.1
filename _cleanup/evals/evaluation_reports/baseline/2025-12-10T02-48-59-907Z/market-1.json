The provided chunks contain information about Microsoft's quarterly financial results, including revenue figures for different business segments (Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, More Personal Computing), growth percentages, and shareholder returns. However, there is no specific information about what the user might have been asking about (the original question is not provided, but the answer indicates the specific information requested was not present). The model correctly identified that the requested information was not available in the context rather than hallucinating an answer, which demonstrates faithfulness to the source material."
