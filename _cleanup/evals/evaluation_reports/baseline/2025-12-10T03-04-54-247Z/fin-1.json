      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The answer directly addresses the question by providing AMD's total revenue in Q3 2024 as $6.8 billion. It also provides additional relevant context including year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth percentages, as well as information about the Data Center segment's contribution. The answer is well-sourced with citations and completely responsive to the user's question."

      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer is completely faithful to the provided context. All claims are directly supported: (1) Total revenue of $6.8 billion is stated in Chunk 9, (2) YoY change of +18% is stated in Chunk 9, (3) QoQ change of +17% is stated in Chunk 9, and (4) Data Center business accounting for more than 50% of revenue mix is explicitly stated in Chunk 3. The answer contains no hallucinations or information beyond what is present in the context."

      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly states AMD's total revenue in Q3 2024 was $6.8 billion and that it represented an 18% year-over-year increase, which matches the ground truth exactly. The answer also provides additional accurate details (QoQ change and Data Center revenue mix) that are consistent with and expand upon the ground truth without contradicting it."
