The answer uses the 50% figure from Chunk 1, which appears to be labeled as 'gross_margin' in the JSON data. The answer appropriately notes that QoQ growth is not found in sources.

The generated answer provides additional accurate details (gross margin, operating margin) that are consistent with being more detailed.

Q3 2025 data center revenue of $30.8B (actually $30,771M) with +17% QoQ and +112% YoY is supported by Chunk 3.

Q3 2024 data center revenue of $14.5B up 41% sequentially and 279% YoY is supported by Chunk 5. However, the claim that 'data center segment has become NVIDIA's dominant revenue driver, representing over 90% of total company revenue' is not explicitly stated in the context. While the data shows data center is the largest segment, the 90% figure would need to be calculated and is not directly stated.

These are all triple-digit growth rates. The Q4 2025 figure of +93% YoY is close to triple digits and still represents significant growth. The answer also confirms the AI GPU demand driver by noting the data center segment has become dominant (over 90% of revenue).

The revenue figure of $121.9B, operating income of $11.4B, and operating margin of 34.6% can be verified from Chunks 5-8 which show AWS quarterly data. The $92B annualized run rate from Q3 2023 is correctly cited from Chunk 4. However, there are some minor issues: (1) The answer states 'most recent quarter' but the data shows multiple quarters - the specific quarter should be identified (appears to be Q3 2025 based on the tables). (2) The TTM figures are correctly derived from the context. (3) The answer appropriately acknowledges that overall Amazon financial performance metrics are not found in the provided sources, which is accurate - the chunks focus on AWS and segment-level data rather than consolidated company financials. The answer avoids hallucination by not fabricating information not present in the context."

The answer is relevant and responsive to the question, explaining both what was not found and what related information was available.

The answer appropriately acknowledges the limitations of the available data. However, there are minor issues: (1) The citation format [C1-C10] doesn't perfectly match the chunk numbering system, (2) The claim about 'historical quarterly revenue data available for 2025 Q1-Q3, 2023 Q2-Q4, 2022 Q2-Q4, 2020 Q3' is somewhat imprecise as the chunks don't clearly label which quarters they represent. The core conclusion that 2026 AWS guidance is not available is accurate and well-supported by the context."

It correctly identifies that Copilot revenue data is not available in the Q1 2022 sources, provides context about what data IS available (total revenue of $45.3B), and explains that Copilot was not mentioned as a separate line item in the financial reports or earnings calls from that period. This is an appropriate and informative response to a question about data that doesn't exist in the sources."

It correctly states that Q1 2022 revenue was $45.3B (matching the $45,317 million in C1), notes the 22% YoY growth (matching C1), and accurately concludes that Copilot revenue is not mentioned in any of the provided chunks. The answer appropriately states 'Not found in provided sources' since none of the 9 chunks contain any reference to Copilot or Copilot revenue. The answer does not hallucinate or add information beyond what is in the context."

While the generated answer provides additional context and explanation about what was searched (Microsoft's Q1 2022 revenue, earnings call content, etc.), the core factual conclusion is identical to the ground truth. The extra detail is consistent with and supports the 'not found' conclusion, so this does not reduce the score."
