  "question": "What did AMD's CEO say about AI demand in recent earnings?",
  "ground_truth": "AMD CEO Lisa Su emphasized strong AI demand, particularly for MI300 accelerators, and outlined plans to expand AI product portfolio to capture growing market opportunity.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n• Not found in provided sources - AMD CEO's specific statements about AI demand\n• Not found in provided sources - Direct quotes from AMD's CEO regarding AI market outlook\n• Not found in provided sources - CEO commentary on AI demand trends or forecasts\n Final Answer:\nNot found in provided sources. The provided context contains fragments from AMD earnings call transcripts but does not include any direct statements from AMD's CEO about AI demand. The context snippets reference gross margin discussions for MI300 products and customer ramp challenges, but lack specific CEO commentary on AI demand trends or outlook.",

    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.6,
      "reasoning": "The answer is partially relevant as it acknowledges the question and attempts to address it. It correctly identifies that the specific information requested (AMD CEO statements about AI demand) was not found in the available sources. The answer also provides some context about what was found (gross margin discussions, MI300 products, customer ramp challenges), which shows engagement with the topic. However, it doesn't fully satisfy the user's information need since no actual CEO statements about AI demand are provided."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.9,
      "reasoning": "The answer correctly identifies that the specific information requested (AMD CEO's statements about AI demand) is not present in the provided context. The context chunks contain metadata about operating environment challenges and fragments of analyst questions, but do not include direct CEO statements about AI demand. The answer appropriately notes what IS in the context (gross margin discussions, customer ramp challenges) while being transparent about what is NOT found. This is a faithful response that avoids hallucination by not fabricating CEO quotes or statements that aren't in the source material."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.2,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer states the information was 'not found in provided sources' and fails to provide any of the key facts from the ground truth. The ground truth specifically mentions Lisa Su emphasizing strong AI demand for MI300 accelerators and plans to expand the AI product portfolio. While the generated answer does mention MI300 products exist in the context, it incorrectly claims there is no CEO commentary on AI demand. The answer is essentially a non-answer that contradicts the ground truth's assertion that such information exists and can be summarized. A small score is given because it at least references MI300, but the core factual content is missing."
