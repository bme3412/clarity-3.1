      "reasoning": "The answer is completely irrelevant to the question. The question asks for a comparison between Apple and Google's approaches to AI in their consumer products. However, the answer discusses AMD's AI products (MI Series data center chips, AI PCs, EPYC processors) and their market strategy. There is no mention of Apple or Google whatsoever. The answer appears to be responding to an entirely different question about AMD's AI product portfolio and competitive positioning. This is a complete mismatch between the question and the answer provided."

    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The answer is highly faithful to the provided context with only minor organizational differences. All key facts are accurately derived from the chunks: MI325 Q4 launch and H1 2025 ramp (Chunk 4), MI350 H2 2025 with multiple SKUs (Chunk 4), infrastructure compatibility (Chunk 9), 4th-gen EPYC traction (Chunk 6), AI PC positive reviews and seasonality (Chunk 1), client business strength (Chunk 2), customer engagement details (Chunks 3, 6, 7), and strategic approach elements (Chunks 4, 5, 8, 9, 10). The answer appropriately notes that specific financial metrics were not found in the context, which is accurate. The only reason for not scoring 1.0 is the slight interpretive framing in section headers and the summary statement about 'important add' being presented as a direct quote when it's paraphrased from Chunk 1, though the meaning is preserved."

    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer is completely unrelated to the ground truth. The ground truth discusses Apple's on-device AI approach versus Google's cloud-based AI strategy with Gemini models across consumer services. The generated answer instead discusses AMD's data center AI products (MI series chips), AI PCs, and enterprise customer engagement. There is no mention of Apple, Google, privacy considerations, on-device vs cloud processing, or consumer AI services like Search and Photos. The generated answer appears to be responding to an entirely different question about semiconductor/hardware AI products rather than consumer tech company AI strategies."
