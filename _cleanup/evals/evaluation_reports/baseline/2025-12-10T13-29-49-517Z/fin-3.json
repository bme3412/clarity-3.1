  "question": "How has Nvidia's data center revenue changed over the past year?",
  "ground_truth": "Nvidia's data center revenue has grown significantly, driven by AI GPU demand. The segment has shown consistent triple-digit growth rates throughout FY2024-2025.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts Extracted:\n- FY2025 Q4 Data Center revenue: $35.6B, QoQ +16%, YoY +93% [C1]\n- FY2025 Q3 Data Center revenue: $30.771B, QoQ +17%, YoY +112% [C2]\n- FY2025 Q2 Data Center revenue: $26.272B, QoQ +16%, YoY +154% [C3]\n- FY2025 full-year Data Center revenue: $115.2B, more than doubling from prior year [C13]\n- FY2026 Q2 Data Center revenue: $41.1B, QoQ +5%, YoY +56% [C8]\n- FY2024 Q3 Data Center revenue: $14.5B, QoQ +41%, YoY +279% [C17]\n---\nFinal Answer:\nData Center revenue for the trailing twelve months (FY2025) totaled $115.2B, more than doubling from the prior year [C13].\nQuarterly Progression (FY2025):\n- Q2: $26.272B (YoY +154% / QoQ +16%) [C3]\n- Q3: $30.771B (YoY +112% / QoQ +17%) [C2]\n- Q4: $35.6B (YoY +93% / QoQ +16%) [C1]\nSequential growth remained consistent at 16-17% QoQ across all three quarters, while YoY growth moderated from 154% to 93% as the prior-year base expanded [C1][C2][C3]. The Q4 record was driven by the Blackwell ramp commencing alongside continued Hopper 200 sequential growth, with Blackwell delivering $11B in its first quarter—the fastest product ramp in company history [C13].\nRecent Trend (FY2026):\n- Q2 FY2026: $41.1B (YoY +56% / QoQ +5%) [C8]\nYoY growth decelerated to 56% in FY2026 Q2 as comparisons normalized against the FY2025 surge, though absolute revenue continued expanding [C8].",

      "reasoning": "The answer directly and comprehensively addresses the question about Nvidia's data center revenue changes over the past year. It provides detailed quarterly progression data for FY2025, year-over-year growth percentages, quarter-over-quarter changes, and even extends to recent FY2026 data. The answer includes specific revenue figures ($115.2B full year, quarterly breakdowns), growth rates (ranging from 93% to 154% YoY), and contextual information about what drove the changes (Blackwell ramp, Hopper growth). This is a thorough, data-rich response that fully addresses the question."

    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the provided context, but contains some inaccuracies and unsupported claims. Correct elements: FY2025 Q4 Data Center revenue of $35.6B with 16% QoQ and 93% YoY growth is supported by Chunk 1 and Chunk 12. FY2025 Q3 revenue of $30.771B with 17% QoQ and 112% YoY is in Chunk 2. FY2025 Q2 revenue of $26.272B with 16% QoQ and 154% YoY is in Chunk 3. The $115.2B full-year figure and 'more than doubling' claim is supported by Chunk 12. FY2026 Q2 Data Center revenue of $41.1B with 5% QoQ and 56% YoY is in Chunk 4. The Blackwell $11B revenue and 'fastest product ramp' claim is in Chunk 12. Issues: 1) The answer cites 'FY2024 Q3 Data Center revenue: $14.5B' but attributes it to C17, which doesn't contain this - it's actually in Chunk 7. 2) The citation references (C1, C2, etc.) don't match the chunk numbers in the context. 3) The claim about 'Hopper 200 sequential growth' appears to be a slight misquote - Chunk 12 mentions 'Hopper 200' but the context shows 'H200' elsewhere. Overall, the factual content is mostly accurate and derived from the context, with minor citation mapping issues."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer is fully consistent with the ground truth and provides substantially more detail. The ground truth states that Nvidia's data center revenue has grown significantly with 'consistent triple-digit growth rates throughout FY2024-2025.' The generated answer confirms this with specific figures: YoY growth of +279% (FY2024 Q3), +154% (FY2025 Q2), +112% (FY2025 Q3), and +93% (FY2025 Q4). While the Q4 figure of 93% is technically not triple-digit, it's very close and the answer correctly notes the moderation as the base expanded. The answer also confirms the AI GPU demand driver by mentioning Blackwell and Hopper products. The generated answer provides accurate, detailed numerical support for the ground truth's claims."

In the fourth quarter, Data Center revenue of $35.6 billion was a record, up 16% sequentially and 93% year-on-year. As the Blackwell ramp commenced and Hopper 200 continued sequential growth. In Q4, Blackwell sales exceeded our expectations. We delivered $11 billion of Blackwell revenue to meet strong demand. This is the fastest product ramp in our company's history, unprecedented in its speed and scale. Blackwell production is in full year across multiple configurations, and we are increasing supply quickly expanding customer adoption. Our Q4 Data Center compute revenue jumped 18% sequentially and over 2x year-on-year."

In the fourth quarter, Data Center revenue of $35.6 billion was a record, up 16% sequentially and 93% year-on-year. As the Blackwell ramp commenced and Hopper 200 continued sequential growth. In Q4, Blackwell sales exceeded our expectations. We delivered $11 billion of Blackwell revenue to meet strong demand. This is the fastest product ramp in our company's history, unprecedented in its speed and scale. Blackwell production is in full year across multiple configurations, and we are increasing supply quickly expanding customer adoption.
