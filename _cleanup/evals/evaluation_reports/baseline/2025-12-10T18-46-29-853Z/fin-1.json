  "question": "What was AMD's total revenue in Q3 2024?",
  "ground_truth": "AMD's total revenue in Q3 2024 was $6.8 billion, representing an 18% increase year-over-year.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n• AMD's total revenue in Q3 2024 was $6,819 million [C1]\n• Revenue grew 17.6% year-over-year [C1]\n• Quarter-over-quarter growth rate: Not found in provided sources\n• Data Center business accounted for more than 50% of revenue mix [C4]\n Final Answer:\nRevenue: $6.82B (YoY +17.6% / QoQ change not found in provided sources) [C1]\nAMD delivered strong Q3 2024 performance with Data Center business driving more than half of total revenue mix [C4].",
  "duration_ms": 7162,
  "metrics": {
    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The answer directly addresses the question by providing AMD's total revenue in Q3 2024 ($6,819 million or $6.82B). It also provides additional relevant context including year-over-year growth (17.6%) and the contribution of the Data Center segment. The answer is well-cited and comprehensive. Minor deduction because the QoQ data wasn't found, but this doesn't detract significantly from answering the core question."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The answer is highly faithful to the provided context. The revenue figure of $6,819 million ($6.82B) is directly from Chunk 1. The 17.6% YoY growth rate is explicitly stated in Chunk 1 as 'revenue_growth: 17.6'. The statement that Data Center accounts for more than 50% of revenue mix is directly quoted from Chunk 4. The answer correctly notes that QoQ growth rate was not found in the sources, which is accurate - no quarter-over-quarter comparison is provided in the context. The only minor issue is the characterization of 'strong Q3 2024 performance' which, while supported by the gross margin discussion in Chunk 4 ('we are very pleased with our Q3 gross margin performance'), is a slight interpretation rather than a direct quote. Overall, the answer contains no hallucinations and properly cites its sources."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.9,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer provides the correct revenue figure ($6,819 million = $6.82B, which rounds to $6.8B as stated in ground truth). The YoY growth percentage is stated as 17.6% in the generated answer versus 18% in the ground truth - this is a minor discrepancy that could be due to rounding (17.6% rounds to 18%). The generated answer also provides additional accurate context about Data Center business contribution. The slight difference in the percentage representation (17.6% vs 18%) warrants a small deduction, but the core facts are essentially correct."
