  "question": "What did AMD's CEO say about AI demand in recent earnings?",
  "ground_truth": "AMD CEO Lisa Su emphasized strong AI demand, particularly for MI300 accelerators, and outlined plans to expand AI product portfolio to capture growing market opportunity.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n• Not found in provided sources - AMD CEO's specific statements about AI demand\n• Not found in provided sources - Direct quotes from AMD's CEO regarding AI market outlook\n• Not found in provided sources - CEO commentary on AI demand trends or forecasts\n Final Answer:\nNot found in provided sources. The provided context contains fragments from AMD earnings call transcripts but does not include any direct statements from AMD's CEO about AI demand. The available excerpts focus on gross margin questions, supply constraints, and competitive positioning, but lack the specific CEO commentary on AI demand that was requested.",
  "duration_ms": 7284,
  "metrics": {
    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.7,
      "reasoning": "The answer is relevant to the question in that it directly addresses what was asked (AMD CEO statements about AI demand) and explains why it cannot provide the requested information. It acknowledges the topic, indicates the sources were searched, and provides context about what was found instead. While it doesn't provide the substantive answer the user wanted, it is a relevant and honest response that addresses the question rather than being off-topic or non-responsive."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer is completely faithful to the provided context. The answer correctly identifies that the context does not contain direct statements from AMD's CEO about AI demand. The context chunks provided are fragments from earnings call transcripts that discuss topics like Intel competition, software investment challenges, gross margin questions, and list operating environment challenges in metadata - but none contain actual CEO quotes or statements specifically about AI demand. The answer appropriately responds with 'Not found in provided sources' rather than hallucinating information that wasn't present."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer states that the information was 'not found in provided sources' and fails to provide any substantive information about AMD CEO Lisa Su's statements on AI demand. The ground truth clearly indicates that Lisa Su emphasized strong AI demand for MI300 accelerators and outlined plans to expand the AI product portfolio. The generated answer completely misses these key facts and provides no relevant information, essentially failing to answer the question. A small score is given only because the answer acknowledges the topic area (AI demand, AMD CEO) rather than being completely off-topic."
