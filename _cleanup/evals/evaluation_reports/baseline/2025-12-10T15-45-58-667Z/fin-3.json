  "question": "How has Nvidia's data center revenue changed over the past year?",
  "ground_truth": "Nvidia's data center revenue has grown significantly, driven by AI GPU demand. The segment has shown consistent triple-digit growth rates throughout FY2024-2025.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations\n• Q4 2025 data center revenue: $35.6B (YoY +93% / QoQ +16%) [C1]\n• Q3 2025 data center revenue: $30.8B (YoY +112% / QoQ +17%) [C2]\n• Q2 2025 data center revenue: $26.3B (YoY +154% / QoQ +16%) [C3]\n• Q2 2026 data center revenue: $41.1B (YoY +56% / QoQ +5%) [C6]\n• Q3 2024 data center revenue: $14.5B (YoY +279% / QoQ +41%) [C9]\n• Q3 2026 networking revenue: $8.2B (YoY +162%) [C5]\n• Q2 2026 networking revenue: $7.3B [C7]\n• Trailing twelve months data center revenue calculation: Not found in provided sources\n Final Answer\nData Center Revenue: $35.6B (YoY +93% / QoQ +16%) [C1]\nNVDA's data center segment demonstrates exceptional growth momentum across recent quarters. Q4 2025 delivered $35.6B in data center revenue, accelerating 93% year-over-year and 16% quarter-over-quarter [C1]. The segment maintained strong sequential growth throughout fiscal 2025: Q3 at $30.8B (+112% YoY / +17% QoQ) [C2] and Q2 at $26.3B (+154% YoY / +16% QoQ) [C3].\nLooking forward, Q2 2026 data center revenue reached $41.1B, growing 56% year-over-year but moderating to 5% quarter-over-quarter [C6]. Networking revenue within data center surged to $8.2B in Q3 2026, up 162% year-over-year [C5].\nThe growth trajectory reflects strong demand for Hopper H100/H200 platforms and early Blackwell ramp, with sequential quarterly increases consistently in the mid-to-high teens percentage range through fiscal 2025 [C1][C2][C3].\nTrailing twelve months data center revenue total: Not found in provided sources.",

      "reasoning": "The answer directly addresses the question about how Nvidia's data center revenue has changed over the past year. It provides specific quarterly revenue figures with year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth percentages, showing the trajectory from Q3 2024 ($14.5B) through Q4 2025 ($35.6B) and into Q2 2026 ($41.1B). The answer includes relevant context about growth drivers (Hopper platforms, Blackwell ramp). The only minor issue is that the fiscal year naming convention (FY2025, FY2026) may be slightly confusing without clarification, and the trailing twelve months calculation was not provided. Overall, it comprehensively answers the question with detailed, relevant data."

    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.75,
      "reasoning": "The answer contains mostly accurate information derived from the context, but with some issues. The citations are correctly matched to the data in most cases. However, there are some concerns: 1) The answer refers to quarters as 'Q4 2025', 'Q3 2025', etc., but the context chunks don't explicitly label which fiscal quarter each belongs to - the answer appears to be inferring this. 2) The citation [C6] for Q2 2026 data center revenue ($41.1B) actually corresponds to Chunk 4, not Chunk 6. 3) The citation [C9] for Q3 2024 data center revenue ($14.5B) refers to Chunk 7, which doesn't specify the quarter as Q3 2024. 4) The citation [C7] for Q2 2026 networking revenue ($7.3B) correctly references Chunk 9 content. 5) The answer correctly acknowledges that trailing twelve months calculation is 'Not found in provided sources.' The core financial figures are present in the context, but the quarter labeling and some citation numbering appears to be inferred or misaligned rather than directly stated in the context."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer strongly supports and expands upon the ground truth. The ground truth states that Nvidia's data center revenue has grown significantly with 'consistent triple-digit growth rates throughout FY2024-2025.' The generated answer provides specific quarterly data confirming this: Q3 2024 showed +279% YoY, Q2 2025 showed +154% YoY, Q3 2025 showed +112% YoY, and Q4 2025 showed +93% YoY. While Q4 2025's 93% is technically not triple-digit, the answer demonstrates that triple-digit growth was indeed consistent through most of the period mentioned. The generated answer provides substantially more detail with specific revenue figures and growth percentages that are consistent with the ground truth's claim of significant growth driven by AI GPU demand (mentioning Hopper H100/H200 platforms and Blackwell). The answer is factually aligned with the ground truth's assertions."

Our data center compute revenue quadrupled from last year and networking revenue nearly tripled.\n\n[Chunk 8] (Score: 6.741)\n\"capital_expenditures\": {\n      \"cash_paid_pp&e\": {\n        \"value\": 1.637,\n        \"unit\": \"billion USD\",\n        \"notes\": \"Supports GB200/GB300/Blackwell Ultra capacity and Omniverse simulation sites\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"expenses\": {\n      \"cost_of_revenue\": 15.157,\n      \"research_and_development\": 4.705,\n      \"sales_general_and_administrative\": 1.134\n    }\n  },\n  \"operational_highlights\": {\n    \"data_center_innovation\": [\n      \"Blackwell Ultra and GB300 dominate revenue with NVLink rack-scale systems, while Rubin remains on track with Vera, Rubin GPU, CX9 SuperNIC, and Quantum-X interconnects\",\n      \"NVLink Fusion partnerships with Fujitsu and Intel plus NVQLink quantum interconnect and Spectrum-XGS scale-across offerings differentiate AI factory networking\"\n    ],\n    \"networking\": [\n      \"Networking revenue surged to $8.2B (162% YoY) with Spectrum-X, Spectrum-XGS, InfiniBand, NVLink, Quantum-X, and BlueField-4 fueling AI factory performance\"\n    ],\n    \"ecosystem\": [\n      \"Partnerships with OpenAI (10GW commitment), Anthropic, AWS/Human, Palantir, Nokia/6G, and U.S./European sovereign clouds highlight ecosystem breadth\",\n      \"Omniverse, Cosmos, RTX Pro servers, and RTX Remix/RTX Blueprint updates accelerate robotics, industrial, and creative AI use cases\"\n    ],\n    \"strategic_mentions\": [\n      \"Blackwell wafer production on U.S. soil, NVLink adoption by Meta/MSFT/Oracle/xAI, and Spectrum-X annualized revenue >$10B underscore resilience\",\n      \"Customer roadmap includes Anthropic (1GW), huge government builds (Solstice, Equinox, industrial AI cloud), and RoboAI momentum\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"outlook\": {\n    \"q4_guidance\": {\n      \"revenue\": \"65.0 ±2% billion USD\",\n      \"gaap_gross_margin\": \"74.8% ±0.5 pts\",\n      \"non_gaap_gross_margin\": \"75.0% ±0.5 pts\",\n      \"gaap_operating_expenses\": \"≈6.7 billion USD\",\n      \"non_gaap_operating_expenses\": \"≈5.0 billion USD\",\n      \"other_income\": \"≈0.5 billion USD income excluding equity gains\",\n      \"tax_rate\": \"≈17% ±1%\",\n      \"notes\": \"Assumes no China Data Center revenue;
