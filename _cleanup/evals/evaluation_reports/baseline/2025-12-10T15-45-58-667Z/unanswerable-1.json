      "reasoning": "The answer acknowledges the question but fails to provide the requested information. While it's honest about not finding the data in available sources, it doesn't actually answer the question about Tesla's Q2 2019 automotive revenue. A partial score is given for being responsive and honest rather than providing incorrect information, but it ultimately doesn't fulfill the user's information need."

    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer 'Not found in provided sources' is completely faithful to the context, which states 'No context retrieved.' The response appropriately acknowledges the lack of available information without introducing any hallucinated content or claims not supported by the context."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer exactly matches the ground truth. Both indicate that the information was not found in the provided sources, which is a consistent and accurate response."
