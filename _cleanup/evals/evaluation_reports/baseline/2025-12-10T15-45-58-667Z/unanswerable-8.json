  "question": "What was Microsoft’s Copilot revenue in Q1 2022?",
  "ground_truth": "Not found in provided sources.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n• Microsoft Q1 2022 total revenue: $45.317B [C1]\n• Revenue growth: +22% YoY [C1]\n• No quarterly growth data provided [C1]\n• Copilot-specific revenue: Not found in provided sources\n• Copilot was not mentioned in Q1 2022 earnings context [C2-C7]\n Final Answer:\nCopilot revenue for Q1 2022: Not found in provided sources.\nMicrosoft Q1 2022 total revenue: $45.3B (YoY +22%) [C1]\nThe provided Q1 2022 financial data and earnings call transcripts do not contain any references to Copilot or Copilot-specific revenue figures. Microsoft's overall revenue performance was strong with 22% year-over-year growth, but Copilot as a product or revenue segment was not discussed in the available Q1 2022 materials.",
  "duration_ms": 10490,
  "metrics": {
    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is highly relevant to the question. It directly addresses the user's query about Microsoft's Copilot revenue in Q1 2022 by clearly stating that Copilot-specific revenue was not found in the provided sources and that Copilot was not mentioned in Q1 2022 earnings materials. The answer also provides helpful context by sharing Microsoft's total revenue for that period. The response is honest about the limitations of the available data rather than fabricating information. It loses some points only because it cannot provide the specific Copilot figure requested, but this appears to be due to data availability rather than answer quality."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer is completely faithful to the provided context. It correctly states that Microsoft Q1 2022 total revenue was $45.317B (rounded to $45.3B in the answer) from Chunk 1, and that revenue growth was 22% YoY from Chunk 1. The answer accurately acknowledges that Copilot revenue was not found in the provided sources, which is true - none of the 7 chunks mention Copilot or any Copilot-specific revenue figures. The answer does not introduce any hallucinated information and properly cites the sources. All claims made are directly supported by the context provided."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that Copilot revenue was 'Not found in provided sources,' which matches the ground truth. The answer goes further by providing additional context about Microsoft's Q1 2022 total revenue ($45.3B with 22% YoY growth) and explaining why Copilot data wasn't available (it wasn't mentioned in the Q1 2022 materials). This additional detail is consistent with the ground truth and provides helpful context without contradicting the core finding."
