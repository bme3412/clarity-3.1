      "score": 0.6,
      "reasoning": "The answer acknowledges the question about Nvidia's gaming revenue in FY2015 and attempts to address it, but ultimately states the information was not found in the provided sources. While this is a relevant response (it's not off-topic), it doesn't actually provide the requested information. The answer is honest about the limitation and explains why it cannot provide the data, which shows relevance to the question, but the lack of actual answer content reduces the score."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer is completely faithful to the provided context. The context only contains information about Q3 FY2026 financial data and analyst questions about future projections - there is no FY2015 data present. The answer correctly identifies that the requested FY2015 gaming and segment revenue information is 'Not found in provided sources' and accurately notes that the context contains Q3 FY2026 data [C2]. The answer does not hallucinate any FY2015 figures and appropriately states that historical data from that fiscal year would be required to answer the question."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the information is not found in the provided sources, which matches the ground truth. The generated answer provides more detail by explaining what specific information was sought (gaming revenue, segment revenue breakdown, total revenue, performance metrics for FY2015) and notes that the available context only contains Q3 FY2026 data. This additional context is consistent with and supports the ground truth conclusion that the requested information was not available."
