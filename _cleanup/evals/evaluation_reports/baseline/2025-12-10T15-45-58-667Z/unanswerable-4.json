  "ground_truth": "Not found in provided sources.",

      "score": 0.8,
      "reasoning": "The answer is relevant to the question as it directly addresses the query about Meta's Reality Labs operating loss in Q1 2017. While it doesn't provide the specific figure requested, it appropriately indicates that the information was not found in the provided sources and explains what data was available instead. This is a valid and helpful response when the requested information is not in the source material."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The answer is highly faithful to the provided context. The response correctly states that Q1 2017 Reality Labs data is not found in the sources, which is accurate since the context only contains recent data (mentioning 2025 Q3 with $0.47B revenue and +74% YoY change). The answer appropriately cites [C2] for the Reality Labs revenue figure that IS present in the context. The only minor issue is that the answer mentions '2025 Q3' but the context doesn't explicitly state the time period - it just shows the revenue figures. However, the core claim that Q1 2017 data is not available is completely accurate and the answer avoids hallucinating any information not present in the context."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the information is not found in the provided sources, which matches the ground truth. The generated answer provides additional context about what data IS available (2025 Q3 Reality Labs data), but this extra detail is consistent with and does not contradict the ground truth statement that the requested Q1 2017 information was not found."
