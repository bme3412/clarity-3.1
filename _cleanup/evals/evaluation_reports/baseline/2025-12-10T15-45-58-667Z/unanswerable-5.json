  "duration_ms": 9754,
  "metrics": {
    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.7,
      "reasoning": "The answer is relevant in that it directly addresses the question by acknowledging that the specific information about MI325X shipments in 2022 is not available in the provided sources. It appropriately indicates what information IS available (quarterly revenue data) while clearly stating the limitations. However, it doesn't achieve a perfect score because it cannot provide the actual answer requested, though this appears to be due to source limitations rather than irrelevance."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.9,
      "reasoning": "The answer is highly faithful to the provided context. The response correctly states that MI325X, GPU shipments, and unit sales data are 'Not found in provided sources,' which is accurate - none of the chunks contain this information. The answer also correctly cites the quarterly revenue figures from chunks 1-4 (Q1: $5,887M, Q2: $6,550M, Q3: $5,565M, Q4: $5,599M), which match the context exactly. The final answer appropriately acknowledges the limitations of the available data without fabricating information. The only minor issue is that the revenue figures in the context are shown as 5887, 6550, 5565, 5599 without explicit 'M' designation, though the context implies these are in millions based on the financial metrics format."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer's final answer matches the ground truth of 'Not found in provided sources.' While the generated answer provides additional context about what data IS available (quarterly revenue figures) and explains why the specific information wasn't found, this additional detail is consistent with and supports the ground truth conclusion. The core factual determination - that the requested information was not found - is accurate."
