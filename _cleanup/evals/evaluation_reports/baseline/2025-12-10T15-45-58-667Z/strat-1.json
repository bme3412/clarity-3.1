  "question": "What are AMD's strategic priorities for AI as of late 2024?",
  "ground_truth": "AMD is focusing on expanding its Instinct data center GPU portfolio (specifically MI300), enhancing the ROCm software stack to compete with CUDA, and driving adoption across cloud and enterprise markets.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n• Not found in provided sources - specific AI strategy details for 2024\n• Not found in provided sources - strategic priorities for 2024\n• Investment in AI and software stack development mentioned as operating challenge [C2][C3]\n• Software investment described as \"big challenge\" for customer ramp [C2]\n• Customization demands from large cloud and enterprise customers noted as challenge [C2][C3]\n• MI300 gross margin expectations and accretion point referenced but details not provided [C1]\n Final Answer:\nAMD's specific AI strategy and strategic priorities for 2024 are not found in provided sources. The context only contains brief references indicating AMD is investing in AI and software stack development, with software investment characterized as a significant challenge for customer ramp [C2]. The company faces customization demands from large cloud and enterprise customers [C2][C3], and there are references to MI300 gross margin expectations, though specific details are not provided [C1]. Without comprehensive strategic documentation in the provided context, the detailed AI strategy and 2024 priorities cannot be determined from these sources.",

    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.6,
      "reasoning": "The answer partially addresses the question by acknowledging that specific AI strategy details for 2024 are not found in the sources, while still providing relevant information that was available - such as AMD's investment in AI and software stack development, customization demands from cloud/enterprise customers, and MI300 references. The answer is honest about its limitations and provides what context it can, making it somewhat relevant but incomplete in directly answering the strategic priorities question."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer demonstrates strong faithfulness to the context by correctly identifying what information is and isn't present. It accurately notes that specific AI strategy details are not found, while correctly citing that 'Investment in AI and software stack development' appears in the metadata as an operating challenge [C2][C3]. The answer appropriately references software investment as a 'big challenge' for customer ramp from C1, and correctly identifies customization demands from cloud/enterprise customers as mentioned in the metadata. The MI300 reference is also accurate. The answer loses some points because it could have been more precise - the 'big challenge' quote about software investment appears in C1, not C2 as cited. Overall, the answer avoids hallucination by clearly stating when information is not available rather than fabricating details."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.4,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer partially captures some relevant elements but fails to provide the specific strategic details present in the ground truth. It mentions MI300, software stack development, and cloud/enterprise customers - which align with the ground truth's mention of MI300, ROCm software stack, and cloud/enterprise markets. However, the generated answer frames these as challenges rather than strategic focus areas, and critically states that 'specific AI strategy details for 2024' are 'not found in provided sources.' The answer is overly cautious and vague where the ground truth is specific about AMD's focus on expanding Instinct GPU portfolio, enhancing ROCm to compete with CUDA, and driving adoption. The generated answer does not mention ROCm or the competitive positioning against CUDA at all."
