The revenue figures for Q4 FY2025 ($35.6B), Q3 FY2025 ($30.8B), and Q2 FY2025 ($26.3B) are accurately extracted from the context.

However, there are some concerns: 1) The answer mentions 'Q2 FY2026' and 'Q3 FY2026' free cash flow figures which appear to be mislabeled - the context shows Q3 FY2026 figures ($22.1B FCF, $23.8B operating cash flow) but these are labeled inconsistently with the fiscal year naming. 2) The calculation that Data Center represents '87-90%' of total revenue is derived/calculated rather than directly stated. 3) The mention of 'Blackwell product ramp' and '12-month wafer-to-rack lead times' is supported by the analyst questions in the context. 4) The statement about Q1 FY2025 and FY2026 data not being found is accurate.

SUPPORTED: The context confirms Meta AI has 500M+ monthly active users, Advantage+ Shopping campaigns reaching $10B run rate, 22% higher ROAS for US advertisers, Reels ads with 36% higher ROAS, and Shops ads crossing $2B annual run rate. The analyst questions about ROI and infrastructure are also present. NOT SUPPORTED/HALLUCINATED: The specific CapEx figures in the table (Q1: $14.00B, Q2: $14.24B, Q3: $15.82B with 60%, 51%, 44% YoY growth) do not match the context. The context shows Q1 2025 CapEx of $13,692M, Q2 2025 of $17,012M, and Q3 2025 of $19,374M. The cash flow figures cited (Q3 OCF $24.76B, FCF $15.51B; Q2 OCF $19.37B, FCF $10.89B) also don't match - context shows Q3 OCF of $29,999M and FCF of $10,625M, Q2 OCF of $25,561M and FCF of $8,549M. The 2025 CapEx guidance range of $64-72B is mentioned but the context also shows an updated range of $70-72B for full year 2025.

The ground truth states Meta is investing heavily in AI infrastructure including GPU clusters, custom AI chips, and data center capacity. The generated answer confirms this with specific CapEx figures ($64-72 billion for 2025), mentions data center expansion explicitly, and details AI infrastructure investments. While the generated answer doesn't specifically mention 'GPU clusters' or 'custom AI chips' by name, it discusses AI infrastructure, data center expansion, and internal AI workloads which encompass these elements. The answer provides extensive supporting evidence including cash flow data, AI investment focus areas, and ROI metrics that are all consistent with heavy AI infrastructure investment.

However, it fails to adequately address the comparative aspect of the question - how AMD compares to Nvidia. The answer explicitly notes that 'Specific competitive market share data versus NVIDIA was not found' and provides almost no information about Nvidia's position, products, or performance. While the AMD information is relevant and detailed, the question specifically asked for a comparison between the two companies, which is only partially addressed."

Most specific claims can be traced to the chunks: the $4.5B to $5B guidance raise (Chunk 1), product launch timelines (Chunks 3, 6, 9), customer broadening (Chunk 3), EPYC adoption (Chunk 2), Ultra Ethernet support (Chunk 5), Data Center >50% revenue mix driving margins (Chunk 7), and Turin production/launch timing (Chunk 8). However, there are minor issues: the answer states 'MI325X' while the context mentions '325X' and '325' without the 'MI' prefix consistently, and the answer adds some organizational structure and framing language not explicitly in the context. The note at the end about NVIDIA competitive data not being found is appropriate and honest. Overall, the answer stays close to the source material with minimal extrapolation."

However, it fails to mention several critical elements from the ground truth: (1) Nvidia's dominance in the AI accelerator market, (2) CUDA ecosystem lock-in as Nvidia's competitive advantage, (3) AMD's open ROCm software stack specifically (only vaguely mentions 'open ecosystem strategy'), and (4) AMD gaining traction specifically in cloud deployments (though it does mention cloud customers). The generated answer provides extensive detail about AMD's roadmap and financials that goes beyond the ground truth, but misses the core competitive framing of Nvidia vs AMD and the specific mention of ROCm. The answer is not factually incorrect but is incomplete on key comparative points."
