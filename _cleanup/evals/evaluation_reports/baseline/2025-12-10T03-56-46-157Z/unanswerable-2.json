  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts Extracted\n- Not found in provided sources: FY2018 gross margin data\n---\nGross Margin FY2018: Not found in provided sources.\nThe provided context contains only Q4 FY2025 data, including total revenue of $102.5B (up 8% YoY) [C2].

    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.7,
      "reasoning": "The answer is relevant to the question as it directly addresses the query about Apple's FY2018 gross margin. However, it explains that the information is not available in the provided sources rather than providing the actual figure. The response is honest and transparent about the limitation, and correctly identifies that only Q4 FY2025 data was available. While it doesn't answer the question with the requested data, it appropriately responds to the question by acknowledging the information gap."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer is completely faithful to the provided context. The response correctly identifies that FY2018 gross margin data is not present in the provided sources, which only contain Q4 FY2025 information. The answer appropriately cites the context [C2] when mentioning the $102.5B revenue figure. The system did not hallucinate any FY2018 data and accurately reported the limitation of the available information."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that FY2018 gross margin data is not found in the provided sources, which matches the ground truth. The answer provides additional context explaining why (the sources only contain Q4 FY2025 data), but this extra detail is consistent with and supports the core finding that the information is not available."
