  "question": "How has Nvidia's data center revenue changed over the past year?",
  "ground_truth": "Nvidia's data center revenue has grown significantly, driven by AI GPU demand. The segment has shown consistent triple-digit growth rates throughout FY2024-2025.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n- Q4 2025 data center revenue: $35.6B (YoY +93% / QoQ +16%) [C1]\n- Q3 2025 data center revenue: $30.8B (YoY +112% / QoQ +17%) [C2]\n- Q2 2025 data center revenue: $26.3B (YoY +154% / QoQ +16%) [C3]\n- Q4 2024 data center revenue: $18.4B (YoY +409% / QoQ +27%) [C4]\n- Q3 2024 data center revenue: $14.5B (YoY +279% / QoQ +41%) [C5]\n- Full-year 2024 data center revenue: $47.5B (+217% YoY) [C4]\n Final Answer:\nData Center Revenue: $35.6B (YoY +93% / QoQ +16%) [C1]\nNVIDIA's data center revenue has shown explosive growth over the past year. Starting from $18.4B in Q4 2024 [C4], revenue nearly doubled to $35.6B in Q4 2025 [C1]. The segment demonstrated consistent sequential acceleration: Q2 2025 at $26.3B (YoY +154%) [C3], Q3 2025 at $30.8B (YoY +112%) [C2], and Q4 2025 at $35.6B (YoY +93%) [C1].\nWhile year-over-year growth rates moderated from the extraordinary 154% peak in Q2 2025 to 93% in Q4 2025, the absolute dollar increases remained substantial. Quarter-over-quarter growth stayed remarkably consistent at 16-17% across the most recent three quarters [C1][C2][C3].\nThe full-year 2024 data center revenue of $47.5B represented 217% growth [C4], establishing the foundation for continued momentum into 2025.",

      "reasoning": "The answer directly and comprehensively addresses the question about how Nvidia's data center revenue has changed over the past year. It provides specific quarterly revenue figures (Q4 2024 through Q4 2025), year-over-year growth percentages, quarter-over-quarter growth rates, and full-year totals. The answer shows the trajectory of growth, explains how the revenue nearly doubled from $18.4B to $35.6B, and contextualizes the growth patterns. The response is highly relevant, detailed, and well-organized with proper citations."

    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the provided context, but with some issues. The financial figures cited are present in the context: Q4 2025 data center revenue of $35.6B with 93% YoY and 16% QoQ growth is in Chunk 1, Q3 2025 $30.8B (rounded from 30,771) with 112% YoY and 17% QoQ is in Chunk 2, Q2 2025 $26.3B (rounded from 26,272) with 154% YoY and 16% QoQ is in Chunk 3. The Q4 2024 figure of $18.4B and full-year $47.5B with 217% growth are in Chunk 7. The Q3 2024 figure of $14.5B with 279% YoY and 41% QoQ growth is in Chunk 4. However, the answer incorrectly labels citations - it references [C1] through [C5] but the context only provides chunks, and the mapping isn't entirely accurate. The answer also makes interpretive statements about 'explosive growth' and 'consistent sequential acceleration' which are reasonable inferences but not direct quotes. The core numerical data is accurately derived from the context."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer is fully consistent with the ground truth and provides significantly more detail. The ground truth states that Nvidia's data center revenue has grown significantly with 'consistent triple-digit growth rates throughout FY2024-2025.' The generated answer confirms this with specific figures: Q4 2024 (+409%), Q3 2024 (+279%), Q2 2025 (+154%), Q3 2025 (+112%), and Q4 2025 (+93%). While Q4 2025's 93% is technically not triple-digit, the answer shows that most of the period did have triple-digit growth, and the overall narrative of significant growth driven by AI GPU demand is accurately represented. The generated answer provides precise quarterly figures, dollar amounts, and both YoY and QoQ growth rates that substantiate the ground truth's claims about significant growth."
