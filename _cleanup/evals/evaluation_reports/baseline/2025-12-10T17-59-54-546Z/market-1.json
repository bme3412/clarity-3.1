  "question": "How is the cloud computing market affecting Microsoft's business?",
  "ground_truth": "Microsoft Azure continues to show strong growth driven by AI services and enterprise cloud adoption, contributing significantly to overall revenue growth.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n• Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud revenue increased 17% (up 15% in constant currency) in 2026 Q1 [C1]\n• Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud revenue increased 18% (up 16% in constant currency) in 2025 Q4 [C2]\n• Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud revenue increased 12% (up 15% in constant currency) in 2025 Q3 [C3]\n• Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud revenue increased 16% (up 15% in constant currency) in 2025 Q2 [C4]\n• Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 51% to $392 billion in 2026 Q1 [C1]\n• Azure is architected for distributed computing fabric, emphasizing hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructures [C5]\n• Microsoft 365 Consumer cloud revenue increased 26% (up 25% in constant currency) in 2026 Q1 [C1]\n• Productivity and Business Processes revenue was $33.0 billion in 2026 Q1, up 17% [C1]\n Final Answer:\nCloud computing is driving strong growth across Microsoft's key segments. Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud revenue has shown consistent double-digit growth: 16% in Q2 2025, 12% in Q3 2025, 18% in Q4 2025, and 17% in Q1 2026 [C4][C3][C2][C1]. This momentum contributed to Productivity and Business Processes revenue reaching $33.0 billion in Q1 2026, up 17% [C1].\nThe cloud transition is evident in Microsoft's expanding customer commitments, with commercial remaining performance obligation surging 51% to $392 billion [C1]. Microsoft's strategic positioning emphasizes hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructures through Azure's distributed computing fabric, supporting low-latency applications across factory floors, hospitals, and gaming [C5].\nConsumer cloud adoption is also accelerating, with Microsoft 365 Consumer cloud revenue growing 26% in Q1 2026 [C1]. The sustained growth across both commercial and consumer cloud segments demonstrates how the broader cloud computing market expansion is translating into consistent revenue acceleration for Microsoft's core productivity and infrastructure offerings.",

  "metrics": {
    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the question about how the cloud computing market is affecting Microsoft's business. It provides specific, quantified evidence of cloud computing's impact including: revenue growth percentages for Microsoft 365 Commercial and Consumer cloud services across multiple quarters, the growth in commercial remaining performance obligation ($392 billion, up 51%), and strategic positioning in hybrid/multi-cloud infrastructure. The answer demonstrates clear cause-and-effect relationships between cloud market trends and Microsoft's business performance with supporting citations. The only minor limitation is that it focuses primarily on Microsoft 365 and doesn't extensively cover Azure's direct revenue impact, though Azure is mentioned strategically."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the provided context, with most claims properly supported by the chunks. However, there are some citation mismatches: The answer cites [C4] for Q2 2025 data but the actual Q2 2025 data (16% growth) comes from Chunk 1, not Chunk 4. Similarly, [C3] is cited for Q3 2025 but that data (12% growth) is in Chunk 2, and [C2] for Q4 2025 but that data (18% growth) is in Chunk 3. The content itself is accurate - the percentages and facts match what's in the context - but the citation numbering appears to be off. The statement about Azure's distributed computing fabric supporting 'factory floors, hospitals, and gaming' is correctly derived from Chunk 5/6. The $392 billion commercial remaining performance obligation and 51% increase is correctly from Chunk 4. The 26% consumer cloud growth is correctly stated. The main issue is citation accuracy rather than factual hallucination."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.3,
      "reasoning": "The ground truth specifically mentions Microsoft Azure's strong growth driven by AI services and enterprise cloud adoption. The generated answer focuses primarily on Microsoft 365 cloud revenue (both Commercial and Consumer) rather than Azure specifically. While it mentions Azure briefly in the context of distributed computing fabric and hybrid/multi-cloud infrastructure, it does not address Azure's growth metrics, AI services contribution, or Azure's specific role in revenue growth. The answer discusses cloud computing broadly and Microsoft 365 extensively, but largely misses the core subject (Azure) and key driver (AI services) mentioned in the ground truth."
