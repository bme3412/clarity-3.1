The answer correctly acknowledges that QoQ growth is not available in the sources. However, there's a minor issue: Chunk 4 mentions gross margin was 53.6% in Q3, which contradicts the 50% figure from Chunk 1.

The year-over-year growth is stated as 17.6% in the generated answer versus 18% in the ground truth - this is a minor discrepancy (likely due to rounding differences, as 17.6% rounds to 18%). The generated answer provides additional accurate details (gross margin, operating margin) that are consistent with being more detailed.

(2) The '$500 million raise' attribution to [C8] is incorrect - C8 contains final remarks, while the $500 million figure appears in C8's analyst question section. (3) The statement about 'supply chain management and customer delivery' execution is somewhat inferred rather than explicitly stated.

However, the answer incorrectly labels citations - it references [C1] through [C5] but the context only provides chunks, and the mapping isn't entirely accurate.

While Q4 2025's 93% is technically not triple-digit, the answer shows that most of the period did have triple-digit growth, and the overall narrative of significant growth driven by AI GPU demand is accurately represented.

It provides specific Q4 2025 revenue guidance ($37.5B +/-2%) with citations, and honestly notes that specific guidance beyond Q4 2025 was not found in the sources. The answer also provides relevant context about demand visibility and product roadmaps that relate to future revenue expectations. The only reason it's not a perfect 1.0 is that the answer includes some additional information (gross margins, production details) that, while related, goes slightly beyond the specific question about revenue guidance."

The mid-70s margin guidance is supported by C7 and C11. The Blackwell demand and $0.5T visibility claims are supported by C4. The GB300 '1,000 racks per week' claim is supported by C6. The Rubin roadmap claims are supported by C4 and C6. The $1B software/services run rate is supported by C11. However, the core revenue guidance figure of $37.5B is fabricated - the context clearly shows different figures ($65B in C7, $20B in C11). This is a critical factual error that significantly undermines the faithfulness of the response."

The ground truth states Nvidia provided 'optimistic guidance driven by continued AI infrastructure demand, expecting sustained growth in data center revenue.' The generated answer confirms this with specific details: $37.5B Q4 guidance, 'off the charts' Blackwell demand, 'extraordinary' GB200 demand, visibility to $0.5T in Blackwell/Rubin revenue, and references to AI infrastructure spending reaching hundreds of billions. All of these details support the ground truth's characterization of optimistic guidance and AI infrastructure demand. The only minor gap is that the generated answer doesn't explicitly mention 'data center revenue' growth, though the Blackwell/AI infrastructure discussion implicitly covers this. The answer is factually accurate and provides substantially more specificity than the ground truth."
