  "metrics": {
    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.8,
      "reasoning": "The answer is relevant and appropriately addresses the question by clearly stating that the requested information (Slack revenue for Q3 2018) was not found in the provided sources. It explains why - the available context only contains Q2 2026 data. This is a valid and helpful response when the information genuinely isn't available, though it doesn't provide the actual answer to the question (which would require external data). The response is honest and transparent about its limitations."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer is completely faithful to the provided context. The generated answer correctly identifies that the requested information (Slack revenue for Q3 2018) is not present in the provided context, and accurately notes that the context only contains Q2 2026 data. The answer does not hallucinate or fabricate any information - it appropriately states 'Not found in provided sources' and correctly cites that the available context is from Q2 2026 [C1][C2]. This is the correct response when the context does not contain the requested information."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the information is 'Not found in provided sources,' which matches the ground truth exactly. The generated answer provides additional context explaining why the information wasn't found (the sources contain Q2 2026 data rather than Q3 2018 data), but this additional detail is consistent with and supports the core finding that the requested information is not available."
