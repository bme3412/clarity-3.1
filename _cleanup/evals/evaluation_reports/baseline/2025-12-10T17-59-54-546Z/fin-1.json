  "question": "What was AMD's total revenue in Q3 2024?",
  "ground_truth": "AMD's total revenue in Q3 2024 was $6.8 billion, representing an 18% increase year-over-year.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n• AMD's total revenue in Q3 2024 was $6,819 million [C1]\n• Revenue grew 17.6% year-over-year [C1]\n• Quarter-over-quarter growth rate: Not found in provided sources\n• Gross margin was 50% [C1]\n• Operating margin was 10.6% [C1]\n Final Answer:\nRevenue: $6.82B (YoY +17.6% / QoQ not available) [C1]\nAMD delivered strong Q3 2024 performance with gross margin of 50% and operating margin of 10.6% [C1]. Quarter-over-quarter growth comparison not found in provided sources.",
  "duration_ms": 6991,
  "metrics": {
    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The answer directly addresses the question about AMD's total revenue in Q3 2024, providing the specific figure of $6,819 million ($6.82B). It also includes additional relevant context such as year-over-year growth (17.6%), gross margin (50%), and operating margin (10.6%). The answer is well-cited and comprehensive. Minor deduction because some requested information (QoQ growth) was not available, though this is appropriately noted."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the provided context. The revenue figure of $6,819 million ($6.82B), YoY growth of 17.6%, gross margin of 50%, and operating margin of 10.6% are all directly supported by Chunk 1. The answer correctly acknowledges that QoQ growth is not available in the sources. However, there's a minor issue: Chunk 4 mentions gross margin was 53.6% in Q3, which contradicts the 50% figure from Chunk 1. The answer chose to use the 50% figure from Chunk 1 without acknowledging this discrepancy. The answer is mostly faithful but could have noted the conflicting gross margin data."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.9,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies AMD's Q3 2024 revenue as $6,819 million ($6.82B), which matches the ground truth of $6.8 billion. The year-over-year growth is stated as 17.6% in the generated answer versus 18% in the ground truth - this is a minor discrepancy (likely due to rounding differences, as 17.6% rounds to 18%). The generated answer provides additional accurate details (gross margin, operating margin) that are consistent with being more detailed. The slight difference in the YoY percentage prevents a perfect score."
