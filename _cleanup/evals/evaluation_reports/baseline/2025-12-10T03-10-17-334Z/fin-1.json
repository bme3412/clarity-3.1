  "question": "What was AMD's total revenue in Q3 2024?",
  "ground_truth": "AMD's total revenue in Q3 2024 was $6.8 billion, representing an 18% increase year-over-year.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts:\n- Total revenue Q3 2024: $6.8 billion [C11]\n- YoY change: +18% [C11]\n- QoQ change: +17% [C11]\n- Gross margin: 53.6% [C3]\n- Data Center accounts for more than 50% of revenue mix [C3]\nFinal Answer:\nRevenue: $6.8B (YoY +18% / QoQ +17%) [C11]\nGross margin reached 53.6% in Q3, with improvement driven primarily by mix shift as Data Center now exceeds 50% of total revenue [C3]. Q4 guidance targets approximately 54% gross margin [C3].",

    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The answer directly addresses the question by stating AMD's total revenue in Q3 2024 was $6.8 billion. It also provides additional relevant context including year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth percentages, gross margin information, and revenue mix details. The core question is answered clearly and accurately with supporting citations."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The answer is highly faithful to the provided context. The revenue figure of $6.8B and the YoY +18%/QoQ +17% changes are directly supported by Chunk 11. The gross margin of 53.6% for Q3, the Q4 guidance of approximately 54%, and the statement that Data Center accounts for more than 50% of revenue mix are all directly stated in Chunk 3. The only minor issue is that Chunk 13 shows gross margin as 50%, which conflicts slightly with the 53.6% cited from Chunk 3, but the answer correctly uses the figure from the earnings call transcript (Chunk 3) which is the more authoritative source for reported gross margin. All claims in the answer are properly attributed to their source chunks."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly states AMD's total revenue in Q3 2024 was $6.8 billion and that it represented an 18% year-over-year increase, which matches the ground truth exactly. The answer provides additional accurate details (QoQ change, gross margin, Data Center revenue mix) that are consistent with and expand upon the ground truth without contradicting it."
