  "question": "Did Amazon provide 2026 AWS revenue guidance?",
  "ground_truth": "Not found in provided sources.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n- AWS growth momentum mentioned but no specific 2026 revenue guidance provided [C1]\n- AWS operating margins fluctuated from 39.5% in Q1 2025 to 32.9% in Q2 2025 [C2]\n- Total Amazon revenue was $187.8B in Q4 2024 (+10% YoY) and $158.9B in Q3 2024 (+11% YoY) [C3, C4]\n- No specific AWS revenue figures or 2026 guidance found in provided context\n Final Answer:\nAWS 2026 revenue guidance: Not found in provided sources.\nThe provided context contains AWS performance data through Q3 2025, including operating margin fluctuations from 39.5% to 32.9% [C2] and mentions of growth momentum [C1], but does not include specific AWS revenue figures or any forward-looking guidance for 2026.\nTotal Amazon revenue reached $187.8B in Q4 2024 (+10% YoY) [C3], but AWS segment revenue breakouts and 2026 projections are not found in provided sources.",

  "metrics": {
    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.9,
      "reasoning": "The answer directly addresses the question by clearly stating that no 2026 AWS revenue guidance was found in the provided sources. It appropriately explains what information was available (AWS performance data through Q3 2025, operating margins, growth momentum mentions) while confirming the absence of the specific guidance requested. The answer is relevant and responsive, though it includes some additional context about Amazon's total revenue that wasn't strictly necessary for answering the specific question."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.75,
      "reasoning": "The answer is mostly faithful to the context but contains some inaccuracies. The claim that AWS margins fluctuated from 39.5% in Q1 2025 to 32.9% in Q2 2025 is incorrect - the context actually states this was Q1 to Q2 without specifying 2025 (and given the document mentions Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, the margin data appears to be from an earlier period). The answer correctly identifies that no specific AWS 2026 revenue guidance is provided. The total revenue figures ($187.8B for Q4 2024 and $158.9B for Q3 2024) are accurately cited from the context. The answer appropriately acknowledges the limitations of the provided context. The main deduction is for the potential misattribution of the fiscal year for the margin data."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly concludes that AWS 2026 revenue guidance is 'Not found in provided sources,' which matches the ground truth. While the generated answer provides additional context about AWS operating margins, total Amazon revenue, and other details from the sources, the core factual conclusion aligns with the ground truth. The extra detail is consistent and does not contradict the ground truth answer."
