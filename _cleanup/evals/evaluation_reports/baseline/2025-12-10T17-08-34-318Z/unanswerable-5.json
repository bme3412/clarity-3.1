While it doesn't provide a numerical answer, it appropriately indicates that the information is not available in the provided sources and explains what information IS available (quarterly financial data). This is a valid and helpful response when the requested data doesn't exist in the source material."

      "reasoning": "The generated answer is completely faithful to the provided context. The answer correctly states that information about MI325X, GPU shipments, GPU units, and specific GPU product metrics is not found in the provided sources. The context indeed contains only quarterly financial data (revenue, gross profit, margins, etc.) and metadata from earnings call transcripts, but does not contain any specific information about MI325X or GPU shipment/unit data. The answer appropriately acknowledges what IS in the context (quarterly financial data for 2022) while correctly noting the absence of the requested GPU-specific information. There are no hallucinations or fabricated information."

The generated answer provides additional context explaining what was searched for (MI325X, GPU shipments, GPU units, specific GPU product metrics) and what was actually available in the sources (quarterly financial data), but this additional detail is consistent with and does not contradict the ground truth statement."
