  "question": "How is the cloud computing market affecting Microsoft's business?",
  "ground_truth": "Microsoft Azure continues to show strong growth driven by AI services and enterprise cloud adoption, contributing significantly to overall revenue growth.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n• Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud revenue increased 17% (up 15% in constant currency) in 2026 Q1 [C1]\n• Microsoft 365 Consumer cloud revenue increased 26% (up 25% in constant currency) in 2026 Q1 [C1]\n• Intelligent Cloud revenue was $30.9 billion and increased 28% (up 27% in constant currency) in 2026 Q1 [C1]\n• Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 51% to $392 billion in 2026 Q1 [C1]\n• Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud revenue growth was 18% (up 16% in constant currency) in 2025 Q4 [C2]\n• Microsoft 365 Consumer cloud revenue growth was 20% in 2025 Q4 [C2]\n• Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud revenue growth was 12% (up 15% in constant currency) in 2025 Q3 [C3]\n• Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud revenue growth was 16% (up 15% in constant currency) in 2025 Q2 [C4]\n• Azure is architected for distributed computing fabric emphasizing hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructures [C5]\n• Microsoft 365 is evolving into the new operating system by expanding its Total Addressable Market to include first-line workers [C6]\n Final Answer:\nMicrosoft's cloud computing performance shows strong momentum across segments. Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud revenue accelerated to 17% growth in 2026 Q1 [C1], up from 16% in 2025 Q2 [C4], 12% in Q3 [C3], and 18% in Q4 [C2]. Consumer cloud revenue surged 26% in the latest quarter [C1]. \nIntelligent Cloud revenue reached $30.9 billion with 28% growth [C1]. Commercial remaining performance obligation jumped 51% to $392 billion, indicating strong future revenue visibility [C1].\nMicrosoft's strategic positioning centers on hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructure through Azure's distributed computing fabric [C5]. The company is expanding Microsoft 365's addressable market by targeting first-line workers, positioning it as the new operating system [C6]. This integrated cloud strategy drives consumption-based revenue growth while supporting customer sovereignty and compliance needs.",

      "reasoning": "The answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the question about how cloud computing is affecting Microsoft's business. It provides specific revenue figures, growth percentages, and strategic insights across multiple quarters (2025-2026) for various cloud segments including Microsoft 365 Commercial, Microsoft 365 Consumer, and Intelligent Cloud. The answer also discusses Microsoft's strategic positioning with Azure and hybrid/multi-cloud infrastructure. The response is comprehensive, well-cited, and thoroughly explains the positive impact of cloud computing on Microsoft's business performance."

      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the provided context, with most claims properly cited and verifiable. However, there are some issues: 1) The citations [C1]-[C6] don't match the chunk numbering in the context (e.g., the 2026 Q1 data cited as [C1] is actually from Chunk 4, not Chunk 1). 2) The claim about 'accelerated to 17% growth' implies a trend analysis that slightly overstates the narrative - the growth rates fluctuated (16% Q2, 12% Q3, 18% Q4, 17% Q1) rather than showing clear acceleration. 3) All factual claims about revenue figures, percentages, and strategic positioning are present in the context. 4) The interpretation about 'strong momentum' and 'strategic positioning' are reasonable inferences from the data provided. The answer doesn't contain hallucinated information but has minor citation mapping issues and slightly interpretive framing."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 0.7,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer demonstrates strong cloud performance with specific metrics showing growth (Intelligent Cloud revenue up 28%, Azure mentioned as key infrastructure), which aligns with the ground truth's assertion of 'strong growth.' However, the generated answer focuses heavily on Microsoft 365 metrics rather than specifically highlighting Azure and AI services as the drivers, which is the key point in the ground truth. Azure is mentioned but only in the context of architecture, not as a growth driver. AI services are not explicitly mentioned as a growth contributor. The answer is factually consistent with strong cloud growth but doesn't specifically confirm the ground truth's emphasis on Azure and AI services being the primary drivers."
