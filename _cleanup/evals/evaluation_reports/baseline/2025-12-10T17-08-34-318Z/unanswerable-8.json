  "question": "What was Microsoft’s Copilot revenue in Q1 2022?",
  "ground_truth": "Not found in provided sources.",
  "generated_answer": "Atomic Facts with Citations:\n• Total revenue: $45.3B (+22% YoY) [C1]\n• Gross profit: $31.7B [C1]\n• Gross margin: 69.9% [C1]\n• Operating income: $20.2B [C1]\n• Operating margin: 44.7% [C1]\n• Net income: $20.5B [C1]\n• Operating cash flow: $24.5B [C1]\n• Commercial bookings up 14% (slowdown from prior quarter's 25%) [C3]\n• Copilot-specific revenue: Not found in provided sources\n Final Answer:\nCopilot revenue for Q1 2022: Not found in provided sources.\nMicrosoft Q1 2022 overall financial performance:\n- Revenue: $45.3B (YoY +22%) [C1]\n- Gross margin: 69.9% [C1]\n- Operating margin: 44.7% [C1]\nCommercial bookings grew 14%, representing a deceleration from the prior quarter's 25% growth [C3]. The provided context contains comprehensive Microsoft Cloud strategy discussions including Azure, Dynamics 365, Microsoft 365, and Power Platform [C6], but does not include specific Copilot revenue figures or mentions for Q1 2022.",
  "duration_ms": 11858,
  "metrics": {
    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is highly relevant to the question. It directly addresses the user's query about Microsoft's Copilot revenue in Q1 2022 by clearly stating that Copilot-specific revenue was 'Not found in provided sources.' The answer is honest about the limitation while still being helpful by providing related financial context from Q1 2022. This is an appropriate response when the specific information requested isn't available in the source material. The answer loses some points only because it includes substantial additional information that wasn't directly asked for, though this context is still relevant to Microsoft's financial performance."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the provided context. The financial metrics (revenue $45.3B, gross profit $31.7B, gross margin 69.9%, operating income $20.2B, operating margin 44.7%, net income $20.5B, operating cash flow $24.5B) are all accurately derived from Chunk 1. The 22% revenue growth is also correctly cited from Chunk 1. The commercial bookings figure of 14% (down from 25%) is accurately referenced from Chunk 3, which mentions 'commercial bookings up 14%, which is a slowdown from last quarter's 25%'. The answer correctly states that Copilot revenue is not found in the sources, which is accurate as there is no mention of Copilot in any of the chunks. The slight deduction is because the answer presents some information about Microsoft Cloud strategy that, while present in the context, adds interpretive framing not explicitly stated in the same way in the source material."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that Copilot-specific revenue was 'Not found in provided sources,' which matches the ground truth. The answer provides additional context about Microsoft's Q1 2022 financial performance, but this extra detail is consistent and does not contradict the ground truth. The key fact - that Copilot revenue information is not available in the sources - is accurately conveyed."
