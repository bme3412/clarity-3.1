      "score": 0.8,
      "reasoning": "The answer is relevant to the question as it directly addresses whether the requested information (Meta's Reality Labs operating loss in Q1 2017) can be found. The answer correctly acknowledges that the information is not available in the provided sources and explains what data IS available (2025 Q3 data). This is a legitimate and helpful response when the requested information doesn't exist in the context. The answer is honest about the limitation rather than fabricating data."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The answer is completely faithful to the provided context. The response correctly identifies that the context does not contain information about Reality Labs operating loss for Q1 2017. The answer accurately notes that the context only contains 2025 Q3 data, and correctly cites the Reality Labs revenue figure of $0.47B with +74% YoY change from Chunk 2. The answer appropriately states 'Not found in provided sources' rather than hallucinating information that isn't present in the context."

    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer correctly identifies that the information about Reality Labs operating loss for Q1 2017 is not found in the provided sources, which matches the ground truth. The generated answer provides additional context about what information IS available (2025 Q3 data), but this extra detail is consistent with and does not contradict the ground truth. The core factual determination - that the requested information is not available - is accurate."
