  "ground_truth": "Not found in provided sources.",

The MI325X GPU is referenced only in 2024 Q3 materials as a product in AMD's roadmap [C7], indicating it was not available in 2022.\nGPU shipments for 2022: Not found in provided sources. The provided financial data contains consolidated revenue figures but no discrete GPU unit shipment or sales volume metrics.\nGPU unit sales for 2022: Not found in provided sources.\nThe 2022 context includes only aggregate quarterly financials:\n- Q1 2022 revenue: $5.9B (+70.9% YoY) [C4]\n- Q2 2022 revenue: $6.6B (+70.1% YoY) [C3]\n- Q3 2022 revenue: $5.6B (+29% YoY) [C2]\n- Q4 2022 revenue: $5.6B (+16% YoY) [C1]\nSegment-level GPU or Data Center GPU breakouts are not present in the provided sources.

  "duration_ms": 14306,
  "metrics": {
    "relevance": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is highly relevant to the question. It directly addresses whether MI325X units were shipped in 2022 by correctly identifying that the MI325X was not available in 2022 (it's a 2024 product). The answer also explains that no GPU shipment data was found in the sources for 2022. While the answer includes additional context about 2022 revenue that wasn't strictly asked for, it thoroughly addresses the core question by explaining why the specific data cannot be provided. The response is informative and honest about the limitations of the available data."
    },
    "faithfulness": {
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "The answer is largely faithful to the provided context. It correctly states that MI325X is not mentioned in 2022 context and only appears in later materials (Chunk 10 references MI325X). The quarterly revenue figures cited are accurate based on the JSON data in Chunks 1-4: Q1=$5,887M (~$5.9B), Q2=$6,550M (~$6.6B), Q3=$5,565M (~$5.6B), Q4=$5,599M (~$5.6B). The year-over-year growth percentages match the 'revenue_growth' fields. The answer correctly notes that GPU shipment/unit data is not present in the sources. The operating environment challenges mentioned (supply constraints, weak PC market) are supported by Chunks 6 and 8. Minor deduction because the answer references chunk numbers [C1-C11] that don't perfectly align with the actual chunk numbering provided, and some specific claims about 'Data Center GPU breakouts' go slightly beyond what's explicitly stated, though the conclusion that such data is absent is correct."
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The generated answer is consistent with the ground truth. The ground truth states 'Not found in provided sources' and the generated answer confirms this for the specific items requested (MI325X data for 2022, GPU shipments, GPU unit sales). While the generated answer provides significantly more detail including quarterly revenue figures and contextual information about the MI325X appearing only in 2024 materials, all of this additional information is consistent and does not contradict the core finding that the requested GPU-specific data was not found in the sources."
